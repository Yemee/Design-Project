TheSingleWoman;No matter how trying &amp  difficult &amp  discouraging life can be at times, it is still a wildly beautiful thing to JUST BE ALIVE.
TheSingleWoman;Life is far too fleeting to be spent waiting around on people to bring you flowers when you could be picking your own.
TheSingleWoman;Affirmation: I define me, &amp  God defines me. I am my own, &amp  my happiness &amp  peace &amp  self-worth is up to ME.
TheSingleWoman;Much like the leaves fall from the trees without regret...it's time to let go of anything or anyone standing between you &amp  happiness.
TheSingleWoman;Let ppl do what they wanna do &amp  act how they wanna act. THEIR BAD BEHAVIOR DOES NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU define you.
TheSingleWoman;Because yes...sometimes a dating app can change your life: https://t.co/zmWR2xPuMf @bumble_app
TheSingleWoman;You are a whole, complete person made up of many beautiful parts &amp  many broken parts - &amp  it is enough. It is always enough.
TheSingleWoman;Some ppl bump into our lives for a second &amp  it changes us forever &amp  they never know it. And that's ok. They served their purpose.
TheSingleWoman;Some people come into our lives not to be loved but to be lost &amp  learned from in order to help us change &amp  grow.

TheSingleWoman;Run away from a man who can't handle your ambition. ~@RWitherspoon 🙌🏻😎✌🏻
TheSingleWoman;It's so empowering &amp  freeing &amp  beautiful &amp  affirming to walk away from someone who doesn't want you.
TheSingleWoman;When you let go, something magical happens. You give God room to work.
TheSingleWoman;Anyone you have to shrink down for is not someone meant for you. The right one will encourage your smarts, your success, your growth.
TheSingleWoman;Give yourself permission to evolve. You don't have to stay in any relationship, job, or situation that no longer fits you.

TheSingleWoman;Love isn’t always black &amp  white, as I once thought. But it’s also not a constant struggle. A constant question. Constant confusion.

TheSingleWoman;B/c trying a dating app can be intimidating. I've put together some pointers: https://t.co/c9eaaVIugG
TheSingleWoman;Their bad behavior says nothing about your worth. Don't let their refusal to love you stop you from loving yourself.
TheSingleWoman;You'll never be perfect. You 'll sometimes love wrong ppl &amp  choose wrong things. And that's okay. That's how you learn &amp  grow.
TheSingleWoman;Searching for closure? My book @NeverBeen2Vegas can help: https://t.co/nI3xFHaNJO https://t.co/vDrJWfMBOv

TheSingleWoman;It's better to have nobody than to have someone who is halfway there, or doesn't want to be there. ~Unknown
TheSingleWoman;Don't settle. It's better to face a little loneliness now than a lifetime of loneliness with the wrong person.
TheSingleWoman;Whether it's the wrong thing at the wrong time...or just something you don't want to do...don't be afraid to gracefully say no.
TheSingleWoman;What quote of mine would you guys be interested in seeing on a t-shirt? Feedback, please! :)

TheSingleWoman;#ThrowbackThursday to my first book #TheSingleWoman 💗 https://t.co/yowKrNWRiB
TheSingleWoman;@ktmaria11 Sending you love, Katie 😘
TheSingleWoman;Be exactly who you are... Awkward. Clumsy. Quirky. Shy. Nerdy. Weird. Colorful. Flawed. The right people will love you for it.
TheSingleWoman;If you're willing to put up with anything, that's exactly what you'll get.  Set standards. And don't apologize for them.
TheSingleWoman;Feeling like an option instead of a choice? I think my book #BeautifulUncertainty will speak to you:… https://t.co/jEb8U7Z4ez
TheSingleWoman;Be at peace with who u are, how you look, what u have, where you've been, where you're going. Everything is just as it should be.
TheSingleWoman;I'm not going to beg you to treat me right. I'm just going to remove myself from your presence if you don't. #Next
TheSingleWoman;We’re women. Nothing gets by us. Especially a man on his way out the door... https://t.co/90PhI95tBz
TheSingleWoman;Games are a waste of time. Be upfront &amp  honest about what you want. Honesty only scares off ppl who weren't that invested to begin with.
TheSingleWoman;Stop questioning yourself bc someone doesn't get you, love you, or appreciate you. Their opinion says nothing about your worth.
TheSingleWoman;Y'all. I took the plunge &amp  joined @bumble_app! My first foray into dating in 2.5 YEARS! https://t.co/4eh5aJ4F4K
TheSingleWoman;Never base your confidence, happiness, or sense of worth on other person. That's too much weight to put on any relationship.
TheSingleWoman;Stop looking for validation from other ppl. You don't need anyone's permission to grow, to change, to be exactly who you are.
TheSingleWoman;@HappiHabits 😘
TheSingleWoman;Not really what I do, man 😐  Might I suggest @bumble_app? 👍🏻 https://t.co/kDUn21NYvE
TheSingleWoman;It's okay to take your time. It's okay to bravely chart your own path. It's okay to do things your way. It's OKAY.
TheSingleWoman;It's kind of funny, the things guys think we don't know... https://t.co/90PhI9n4t7 https://t.co/4GLYbUyBco
TheSingleWoman;Thanks for posting my quote, @JLo! 😘 https://t.co/2OYxdRTb0f
TheSingleWoman;@lisagarza2 Wow! Go girl!!! 👊🏻
TheSingleWoman;Be exactly who you are...no more, no less. If it's not enough or too much for some people...they're not your people.
TheSingleWoman;You don't have to defend or explain your decisions to anyone. It's your life. Live it without apologies.
TheSingleWoman;A month ago I woke up one day &amp  knew it was time to get back out there again. So I signed up for @bumble_app: https://t.co/4eh5aJ4F4K
TheSingleWoman;You can’t change what happened today. But you CAN make peace with it, learn the lessons it came to teach, &amp  try again tomorrow.
TheSingleWoman;When you release expectations, you are free to enjoy things for what they are instead of what you think they should be.
TheSingleWoman;Struggling to forgive? My book #BeautifulUncertainty can help: https://t.co/kUu7PX6nmS https://t.co/z2sLbMPzHq
TheSingleWoman;Letting go doesn't mean you stop caring. It means you stop trying to force others to.
TheSingleWoman;Change can be scary, but you know what's scarier? Allowing fear to stop you from growing, evolving, and progressing.
TheSingleWoman;If you put yourself out there &amp  it doesn't go well..at least you'll have peace. It's much easier to live with rejection than regret.
TheSingleWoman;One month ago I decided to start something new &amp  trust in the magic of beginnings. And it's changed my life: https://t.co/4eh5aJ4F4K
TheSingleWoman;Because if you don't try...you'll never know... https://t.co/6hsbiloZC9
TheSingleWoman;To risk gaining everything is to risk losing everything...&amp  that's a scary place to be. But it's also an exhilarating place to be.
TheSingleWoman;Nothing big or amazing or life-changing can come to us in life without a little risk.
TheSingleWoman;You truly do have to do something you’ve never done if you want to get something you’ve never gotten: https://t.co/4eh5aJmfWi
TheSingleWoman;Walking around with defenses &amp  guards &amp  walls around your heart isn't living. It's protecting yourself from living.
TheSingleWoman;When you open yourself up, become vulnerable..you risk feeling both good things AND bad things. But it's the only REAL way to live.
TheSingleWoman;Ohhhh how I'm learning this with this new bumble journey I'm on! I woke up about a month ago &amp … https://t.co/CH9Yg536Pf
TheSingleWoman;What's your opinion on #celibacy? Check out the video on my FB page &amp  leave your feedback! --&gt  https://t.co/tBNRyFOpPr
TheSingleWoman;Oh snap! @TheSingleWoman is on @bumble_app! :) https://t.co/4eh5aJ4F4K
TheSingleWoman;@carreyholic You've gotta give @bumble_app a try, girl. It's sooooo much better! 🙌🏻
TheSingleWoman;My Big News! 👉🏻 https://t.co/4eh5aJ4F4K https://t.co/Zqzi3UmEMi
TheSingleWoman;Big announcement coming today, y'all! :) :) :)
TheSingleWoman;Sometimes you have to distance yourself to save yourself.
TheSingleWoman;A relationship is not meant to fix, repair, or complete you. YOU have to do those things yourself. A relationship is just a bonus.
TheSingleWoman;There is no magical cure, no simple answer, to moving on. There is simply day by day, one foot bravely in front of the other.
TheSingleWoman;To be disappointed in love, over &amp  over again, can cause us to stop believing &amp  dreaming &amp  hoping &amp  wishing: https://t.co/JsGAghTqw0
TheSingleWoman;Welcome the uncertainty, and the discomfort, and the stretching. It means you're GROWING! :)
TheSingleWoman;Sometimes all you can do is hold on for dear life &amp  SURVIVE. And show yourself a little compassion &amp  understanding in the process.
TheSingleWoman;You have the right to set standards &amp  boundaries for your life &amp  no one gets to tell you you're being too picky! It's your life.
TheSingleWoman;All the things you're hoping for will arrive when you're most ready for them...not one moment sooner or one moment later.
TheSingleWoman;If this sounds like the season you're in, my book #BeautifulUncertainty is for you: https://t.co/kUu7PX6nmS https://t.co/kU8QvyPGVn
TheSingleWoman;You can get frustrated with waiting, or you can get thankful that what you're waiting for didn't get here before you were ready for it.
TheSingleWoman;Every season of life serves a purpose...the difficult seasons, the happy seasons, &amp  yes, even the waiting seasons.
TheSingleWoman;Because sometimes God just feels really far away: https://t.co/LxfzpvqYRm
TheSingleWoman;When it comes to dating, trust your gut &amp  follow your instincts. You'll know when it's time to get back out there again.
TheSingleWoman;There's no way you can be a healthy partner or attract a healthy partner until you first become a healthy person.
TheSingleWoman;Scary, beautiful, necessary change. I'm learning to embrace it. How about you? 💗 https://t.co/JDmzuNUzzo
TheSingleWoman;"""Sometimes survival is about whatever gets you through the day..."" https://t.co/LxfzpvqYRm https://t.co/W3yp6czm2m"

TheSingleWoman;Let's not let fear rule the day anymore...k? 🙌🏻 https://t.co/UiI1YV9p9C
TheSingleWoman;Just let go a little.  It will all be okay.
TheSingleWoman;Breathe. Surrender. Trust. Everything will work out in the right way, at the right time.
TheSingleWoman;You should never have to fight for someone's time, love, or attention. If it's not freely given, it's not worth having.
TheSingleWoman;It's okay if you didn't get everything done today that you meant to get done. Show yourself grace &amp  try again tomorrow.
TheSingleWoman;Three Lies Us Single People Need to Stop Telling Ourselves: https://t.co/tr1xB76oEr
TheSingleWoman;I hope you know you're capable &amp  brave &amp  significant...even when it feels like you're not. ~Unknown
TheSingleWoman;You can learn from anything. You can choose to see a regret or a mistake as a lesson &amp  let it change your life for the better.
TheSingleWoman;Growth, transition, change...it hurts. It's scary. It's uncomfortable.  But is it ever worth it.
TheSingleWoman;"If you've ever had an ""almost love""...this post is for you: https://t.co/7y26BFwGJC"
TheSingleWoman;Trust the process. Lean into it. The ups, the downs, the highs, the lows, the happiness, the hurt. It all shapes you.
TheSingleWoman;Sometimes it takes the most painful lessons to bring about the biggest blessings. Trust your journey. Every step of it.
TheSingleWoman;You will never have to force friendships, relationships, or situations that are truly meant to be.
TheSingleWoman;Almost Doesn't Count...Or Does It? https://t.co/7y26BFwGJC https://t.co/rCEcqo11Si
TheSingleWoman;Some ppl aren't meant to be your great love. Or even a love at all.  Sometimes they're just there to get you ready for it.
TheSingleWoman;it does no good to wait around on someone’s feelings to catch up to yours. Sometimes you just have to move on.

TheSingleWoman;Everything we feel, do, &amp  become starts in our minds first. It is VITAL to keep that sacred space positive &amp  nurturing &amp  loving.
TheSingleWoman;#Goals: Let yourself off the hook a little. Be kinder to you. Speak to yourself the way you would a friend. Show yourself grace.

TheSingleWoman;Treat yo'self! A monthly swag box just for singles...WHAT?! https://t.co/WpJeybzzfy   coupon code MANDY for 10% off! https://t.co/S9emgeY4Yi
TheSingleWoman;You will never lose something that's TRULY meant for you by letting it go. You're giving it either room to GROW or room to GO.
TheSingleWoman;The heart of who we are...it never really changes. It just gets covered up sometimes by the storms &amp  uncertainties of life.
TheSingleWoman;Sometimes we just have to live in the moment &amp  enjoy it for what it is without thinking too hard about where it's going.
TheSingleWoman;It's brave to open yourself up to love, knowing it might not last forever &amp  being okay when it doesn't.
TheSingleWoman;"""For the first time in my life, I questioned whether or not there was really a happy ending out there for me"" - https://t.co/JsGAghTqw0"
TheSingleWoman;There is no need to rush.  Or hurry. Or stress. Or worry.  With faith, &amp  hope, &amp  a little time...everything falls into place
TheSingleWoman;When you let go, something magical happens. You give God room to work.

TheSingleWoman;Go to bed tonight in peace. Nothing happened today that can't be fixed or healed or made better tomorrow 💗
TheSingleWoman;It's really pretty simple. If they love you...if they want to be with you...they'll show it. They won't leave any room for doubt.
TheSingleWoman;If his words say one thing &amp  his actions another..if you are more confused in the relationship than content..walk away.

TheSingleWoman;Change has to happen in the inside before it can show up on the outside. The more positive your thoughts, the more positive your LIFE.
TheSingleWoman;When you don't know what else to do...keep showing up. Take tiny steps in faith. Trust your journey. And the path will become clear.
TheSingleWoman;Instead of wasting time worrying about other ppl, focus on your own life &amp  the things you have the power to change.
TheSingleWoman;Sometimes closed doors are a bigger blessing than open ones. Trust in the providence of God's protection.
TheSingleWoman;Life After Loving a Narcissist: https://t.co/m2FiGkI5nX

TheSingleWoman;Happy Tuesday 💗 https://t.co/DuhlscC896
TheSingleWoman;Your past does not define you. Your ex does not define you. Your mistakes &amp  failures don't define you. YOU define you.
TheSingleWoman;It's okay to work on yourself first. To focus on yourself first. To want to find YOU before you look for love.
TheSingleWoman;The right relationships won't have to be forced or chased.  You are worthy of someone who will match your effort.
TheSingleWoman;When you find yourself at a crossroads: Stop. Think. Breathe. Pray. There is no rush.  Better to pause &amp  reflect than act &amp  regret.
TheSingleWoman;Pay attention to a man's actions, not his words.  His behavior is sending you all the clues you need.

TheSingleWoman;When you're ready...open yourself up to love.  But only when you're ready.  Not because you're lonely.
TheSingleWoman;You know what's lonelier than being single? Being with the wrong person: https://t.co/sc2AKZx4Tc
TheSingleWoman;You HAVE to be willing to put yourself out there if you hope to find love. Love can't find you if you're hiding from it.

TheSingleWoman;Try not to just accept your singleness…APPRECIATE it. Honor it. Even revel in it. It's part of who you are, &amp  that makes it beautiful.
TheSingleWoman;Because, singles...your beautiful, brave, bold life choices deserve to be celebrated, too: https://t.co/aFznUtKQOo
TheSingleWoman;Our unfinished, unwritten, imperfect single lives deserve to be honored. Our life choices DESERVE to be recognized.

TheSingleWoman;Sometimes being single can be lonely &amp  uncertain &amp  unsure. It's true. ...But it's still a heck of a lot better than settling.
TheSingleWoman;Be grateful for your path, your blessings, your life. Everything about you is just as it should be.
TheSingleWoman;Single women: You are brave, strong, &amp  u fight battles every day that most ppl will never have to experience. Hold your head high.

TheSingleWoman;Stop regretting yesterday.  Stop stressing tomorrow. One day at a time is all you can do.

TheSingleWoman;You don't have to hide your broken. It's part of what makes you...YOU. https://t.co/CLa92XtGtH
TheSingleWoman;Because you can be 'happily single' &amp  still hope for 'happily ever after':   https://t.co/sc2AKZx4Tc
TheSingleWoman;Go easier on yourself. You are a work in progress, which means you get there a little at a time, not all at once.

TheSingleWoman;Sometimes you just need TIME. My book #BeautifulUncertainty is in stores now: https://t.co/kUu7PX6nmS https://t.co/Css1620ENh
TheSingleWoman;Trust that God is bringing every person, every lesson, every opportunity into your life to get you where you're meant to be.

TheSingleWoman;Don't apologize for the messiness of your process. Change &amp  growth aren't always polite.
TheSingleWoman;It's okay if nothing makes sense to you right now. Just keep moving forward.  Some things will only become clear in hindsight.
TheSingleWoman;You should never have to compromise or lessen yourself for love. You will always be too much or too little for the wrong person.

TheSingleWoman;People won't always love you as much as you love them.  Love them anyway. But know when it's time to move on without them.
TheSingleWoman;Along the way, people will drop outta your life &amp  others will join it. Let them. That's life. Messy, beautiful life.
TheSingleWoman;You will grow. And change. And evolve. And sometimes it will hurt. Because progress is painful. But then it's beautiful.

TheSingleWoman;A healthy relationship will never require you to do all the work &amp  make all the effort. Real love meets you halfway.

TheSingleWoman;Philippines! Good news! My new book #BeautifulUncertainty is now available at some @nbsalert stores! https://t.co/lFInn8hydR

TheSingleWoman;"Just heard the best quote. ""Life is just so lifey."" ☺️  (Thank you, @justinchipman's mom)"

TheSingleWoman;If you're asking yourself this question, my new book #BeautifulUncertainty is for you: https://t.co/kUu7PX6nmS https://t.co/SboJi3af5c

TheSingleWoman;@itsallnthetimin Sending you lots of love! 💜
TheSingleWoman;@sfhsyd10 I don't know about you...but God defines me. And I define me.
TheSingleWoman;@merriday_brandy did you read the blog? Cause everything you're saying is what the blog is actually about :)
TheSingleWoman;Sometimes you have to get really honest with yourself &amp  admit that it's not brave or healthy to wait around for someone to love you.
TheSingleWoman;"""I’ve started to suspect lately that finding yourself, is, in fact, all about losing yourself..."" https://t.co/3Hbpt4w0YB"
TheSingleWoman;You don't need all the answers now. Embrace the questions. God will bring you clarity when He knows you're ready for the next step.
TheSingleWoman;Never regret anything. If it's good, it's wonderful. If it's bad, it's experience. ~Victoria Holt
TheSingleWoman;Define yourself. Don't wait on a man, a job, your friends, your family, or a relationship status to do it for you.
TheSingleWoman;When you release expectations, you are free to enjoy things for what they are instead of what you think they should be.

TheSingleWoman;When you're comfortable in your own skin...you're beautiful.  Confidence is the best makeup you could ever wear.
TheSingleWoman;You don't always see progress as it's happening.  But in the quiet, in the stillness, in the dark... God is working.
TheSingleWoman;Be brave enough to wait. Brave enough to trust. Brave enough to embrace the beautiful uncertainty of BECOMING.
TheSingleWoman;If you loved my first book #TheSingleWoman... Don't miss my latest, #BeautifulUncertainty: https://t.co/kUu7PX6nmS https://t.co/rrMPkj92qa

TheSingleWoman;That thing that happened might never make sense.  But it you surrender it to God, He can still make it beautiful.
TheSingleWoman;"Allow yourself to cry. To feel sad. To fall apart if you need to.  You don't always have to be strong. Or cheerful. Or ""together."""

TheSingleWoman;You're not always going to make the right choices.  The good news is, it takes a few wrong turns to get to the right place.

TheSingleWoman;"Find yourself in an ""in-between"" time? My new book #BeautifulUncertainty is for you: https://t.co/kUu7PX6nmS https://t.co/W9Po0PWA3Y"
TheSingleWoman;Invest your time wisely. It's better to have a few substantial friendships than dozens of surface ones.
TheSingleWoman;Change doesn't always look and feel pretty in the moment, but the outcome of change is glorious. ~#BeautifulUncertainty
TheSingleWoman;A happy life isn't about chasing a man or even having a man, but about being the best woman you can be.
TheSingleWoman;You see the HAND of God in the good times...but you see the HEART of God in the bad times: https://t.co/r3OthQlAHG
TheSingleWoman;Who you choose to love reflects how you feel about yourself. If you're always picking unhealthy ppl, it's time to make some changes.
TheSingleWoman;You can't change what happened to you. But you CAN make peace with it, learn the lessons it came to teach, &amp  let it go.
TheSingleWoman;You don't have to defend or explain your decisions to anyone. It's your life. Live it without apologies.

TheSingleWoman;#BeautifulUncertainty in bookstores now or order at https://t.co/SFK0ZJicM5! https://t.co/jWp86B9L4A
TheSingleWoman;God's plan may not be the one you would have chosen... but I promise it's better than the one you would have chosen.

TheSingleWoman;@jmecandice @amazon @mitch_hamalwa @MissMandyHale Ah the preorder price was $4.99. Now it's $8.99. My apologies!
TheSingleWoman;@gabaky Well then that makes me not sad anymore ☺️ I just don't want to be defined by a graphic instead of my heart.
TheSingleWoman;@SusuTobia If you hide behind a fake pic/handle on Twitter to tweet rude things to ppl, you've really failed life 👎🏼
TheSingleWoman;@gabaky I love God &amp  write/tweet about Him constantly. And a letter on a graphic is what you see, rather than my ❤️. Which makes me sad.
TheSingleWoman;A difficult question I asked &amp  finally found the answer to in my new book #BeautifulUncertainty... https://t.co/yBOK7h36AK
TheSingleWoman;@gabaky My publisher created this graphic &amp  they're a Christian publishing company. It's just a style choice. Not a statement.
TheSingleWoman;Just bc something hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it's not going to. You just might have to wait &amp  trust a little longer.
TheSingleWoman;Sometimes all I can do is thank God that He gave me what was meant for me instead of what I asked for.

TheSingleWoman;@icyprinzess But a pain free life isn't reality. So I look for the silver lining. Bc there is a purpose to everything, even pain.

TheSingleWoman;"You have to see things &amp  ppl as they are, not as you want them to be. Otherwise you could spend years dating someone's ""potential."""
TheSingleWoman;Letting go of an unhealthy relationship is far less painful than continuing to surrender your dignity to hold onto it.
TheSingleWoman;You don't have to settle for whatever life brings you. You can design your own life, your own path, your own destiny!

TheSingleWoman;#PowerfulPrayer: God, please remove anything or anyone from my life that isn't pleasing to you.
TheSingleWoman;Chase happiness instead of ppl or opportunities...because joy draws all the good stuff you're looking for into your life.
TheSingleWoman;Today on my #31DayChallenge, I am daring you to SURRENDER: https://t.co/nYUSZTxWsJ
TheSingleWoman;Don't let go with bitterness, but with peace...knowing that new stories are just waiting on you to turn the page.

TheSingleWoman;A #prayer from my new book #BeautifulUncertainty. Preorder now at https://t.co/SFK0ZJ0BUx 💕 https://t.co/p4Hd9m1UYU
TheSingleWoman;Confidence isn't thinking you're better than everyone.  It's refusing to compare yourself to anyone.
TheSingleWoman;Faith is surrendering your plans to make room for God's. Because no matter how good your plan is... His is always better.
TheSingleWoman;You are not lacking just because you don't have what someone else has, do what they do, or look how they look. #StayInYourLane
TheSingleWoman;You are not lacking. You are not inadequate.  You are beautifully imperfect...&amp  you are ENOUGH.
TheSingleWoman;Ladies, when you tear other women down, it just makes you look petty &amp  insecure. Be a builder-upper instead.
TheSingleWoman;Go to https://t.co/SFK0ZJ0BUx, click yellow preorder button, fill out the form that pops up, download freebies :) https://t.co/lI09pBQTHP
TheSingleWoman;If it's meant for you, you won't have to rush it &amp  you definitely won't have to settle for it.
TheSingleWoman;"""How is faith truly FAITH if you are only willing to follow God thru sunny days but not rainy nights?"" https://t.co/kUu7PX6nmS"
TheSingleWoman;A confident lady doesn't even entertain the idea of settling, b/c she knows she deserves nothing less than God's best for her life.
TheSingleWoman;It's time to break those connections that keep breaking your heart. Check out Day 8 of my #31DayChallenge: https://t.co/CKMSDt3Oml
TheSingleWoman;It's impossible to open yourself up to new love in the new year if you're still clinging to the old loves of years past.
TheSingleWoman;@UciliaWang Hey lady! I have a question for you. Can you follow me so I can DM you?
TheSingleWoman;@_halah Hey lady! I have a question for you. Can you follow me so I can DM you? :)
TheSingleWoman;@samsharf Hey Samantha! I have a question for you...can you follow me so I can DM you? :)

TheSingleWoman;@DenelSantaLucia So wise!!!
TheSingleWoman;Thank you, God, for the strength to stop reliving the past, start living my present, &amp  to trust You with my future.
TheSingleWoman;Being single means you're taking your time deciding how you want your life to be &amp  who you want to spend it with. ~@SJP

TheSingleWoman;Thinking about taking the online dating plunge in 2016? Don't miss #LoveAtFirstSwipe tomorrow night on @TLC! 9:30 CT 📲❤️👫
TheSingleWoman;Sometimes you have to close a few doors before you can open new ones.
TheSingleWoman;If it's broken, fix it. If it's wrong, make it right.  But if it's out of your control...let it go.
TheSingleWoman;Joy is embracing life for what it IS instead of always wishing to be somewhere else, with someone else, doing something else.
TheSingleWoman;You don't get to choose your circumstances, but you do get to choose your attitude about your circumstances.
TheSingleWoman;"We're on Day 7 of 2016. Did you know the number 7 means ""completion""? Which is why today's #31DayChallenge is: https://t.co/jg2NOeni9n"

TheSingleWoman;God can take anything broken...hearts, lives, dreams...and turn it into something beautiful.
TheSingleWoman;I don't force friendships or communication. If it's not mutual, I'll let it go. It's that simple for me. ~@RobHillSr
TheSingleWoman;Dear friend who is doubting everything about yourself in these late night hours: Dry your tears. You are precious &amp  worthy.
TheSingleWoman;If u live in one of these 100+ countries (https://t.co/8NQA52AHem) u can preorder my new book #BeautifulUncertainty from @BookDepository!
TheSingleWoman;#Reminder: You are not a Plan B, a consolation prize, or someone to be settled for. You deserve to be someone's first choice.
TheSingleWoman;Never give up on a lifelong friend or love too soon, but never cling to a seasonal one too long. It's all about balance.
TheSingleWoman;@CandiceNicolePR I am but I haven't used it yet :)
TheSingleWoman;"From tomorrow's email: ""Closure comes in bits &amp  pieces, &amp  sometimes the only closure u get is the decision u make that it's time to move on"""

TheSingleWoman;You will never regret going out of your way to be a little kinder, a little more forgiving, a little more gracious.
TheSingleWoman;International friends! Preorder my new book #BeautifulUncertainty HERE: https://t.co/LLkuyPfHot
TheSingleWoman;If we were never sad, never uncomfortable, never tested...we would never be motivated to change.
TheSingleWoman;It's a disservice to you &amp  your great big beautiful life to keep comparing your journey to others. Embrace your unique path!
TheSingleWoman;If you are not yet where you want to be, it's OKAY. Breathe. Relax. Enjoy the journey. There's joy &amp  purpose in your becoming.

TheSingleWoman;What (Most) Women Want, Vol. I ❤️ Preorder #BeautifulUncertainty at https://t.co/SFK0ZJ0BUx ❤️ https://t.co/UZUwS8DiCp
TheSingleWoman;Letting go is a leap of faith. Letting go wouldn't be letting go if we knew what was on the other side.
TheSingleWoman;If you're unhappy with something, change it. Life is too short &amp  too beautiful to stay stuck somewhere you don't belong.
TheSingleWoman;When the chips are down, remember this:  Happiness could be waiting around the next corner. Life can change just that fast! :)

TheSingleWoman;@IStephyi Where are you?

TheSingleWoman;@LoveCourtK I am abstinent &amp  plan to remain that way til marriage. That hasn't always been the case. Maybe I'll write a blog about this!

TheSingleWoman;@sweetgyrl45 bigger plan for my life. One that doesn't involve marriage right now. And I trust it. As should you for your life. Bc I do know
TheSingleWoman;"@sweetgyrl45 I could just sometimes seek my own will instead of God's &amp  hang up my ""single crown"" once &amp  for all, but He has a different &amp "
TheSingleWoman;@sweetgyrl45 The truth is, when you are diligently seeking God, life doesn't always get easier. Sometimes it gets harder. Trust me, I wish
TheSingleWoman;@sweetgyrl45 Also, if those couples out there in their teens who marry aren't seeking God, then this also doesn't apply to them
TheSingleWoman;"@sweetgyrl45 That's why the sentence starts with ""maybe."" Because it doesn't apply to everyone :)"

KhaliaBraswell;I brought this on myself….still, though.

KhaliaBraswell;I TOTALLY missed that Converse was a subsidiary of Nike since like ’03. I went to the Converse site and was so lost as to why it was so Nike

KhaliaBraswell;Wondering that too re: touchID API! Do you use 1 password? https://t.co/jtJEdHDSP6
KhaliaBraswell;I also wonder how long it'll take for websites to allow you to use touchid to authenticate with the new touch bar..similar to iPhone 🤔

josephbonneau;Follow-up 3: It's Zimmermann with two n's. Sorry Phil for the typo (x2). Anybody writing more about this, please don't propagate the error.
josephbonneau;Follow-up 2: I did get permission to tweet, either from Phil Zimmerman or a humorous MITM hoping to highlight PGP usability challenges :-)
josephbonneau;Follow-up: Yes, that email travelled in plaintext so I'm not 100% sure it's authentic. If it's forged, that's also a telling PGP anecdote
josephbonneau;"Email from Phil Zimmerman: ""Sorry, but I cannot decrypt this message. I don't have a version of PGP that runs on any of my devices"""
josephbonneau;@kaepora @matthew_d_green @graham_steel Bitcoin ASICs are not repurposable, to compare you'd need to analyze gate counts for SHA256/EC ops
josephbonneau;@znjp @yoshi_kohno the hotel prominently put up this sign the morning after the USENIX #sec15 organizers' party http://t.co/5oTCXlLdOe
josephbonneau;@kaepora Just re-computed: In 2014 Bitcoin miners collectively did 2^82 SHA-256 hashes for ≈ US$687M (≈35x more efficient than 2013)
josephbonneau;@kaepora That stat is from my USENIX 2014 paper on memorizing strong passwords. I guess nobody has bothered to compute for 2014.

josephbonneau;@fugueish I said if you want to learn crypto, read @matthew_d_green's blog. If you don't want to learn crypto, maybe rethink your priorities
josephbonneau;@AlecMuffett @hashcat @thorsheim @a_greenberg We have no accurate security metric for long human-chose passphrases so HPS isn't as useful
josephbonneau;@AlecMuffett @hashcat @thorsheim @a_greenberg This is helpful information for deciding what size random passphrase you should use
josephbonneau;"@AlecMuffett I agree that Snowden's advice is okay for most use and @a_greenberg's piece quoted me as saying it's ""fine"" for online accounts"
josephbonneau;"@AlecMuffett: @a_greenberg scoped it as ""Considering that he’s recommended it for someone like Greenwald, who’s going up against the NSA..."""
josephbonneau;@AlecMuffett @a_greenberg If an intelligence agency cares enough to brute-force your GPG key, better-than-average is probably not enough
josephbonneau;@AlecMuffett @a_greenberg Some people might pick a creative phrase the attacker will miss, but we know empirically that many won't.
josephbonneau;@AlecMuffett @a_greenberg This is exactly the scenario Snowden was advising @ggreenwald about initially-one very high value GPG passphrase
josephbonneau;@ProtonMail Listing your cert's hash on a support page is not adding much security https://t.co/Ae5PUuwdwe. Please look into key pinning
josephbonneau;@benadida I would have said attempting to use one-time pads is a serious but honest mistake. Launching with no review is negligent
josephbonneau;@benadida agreed, but apps do many ill-advised things besides one-time pad. Launching in the press w/o security review is a broader red flag
josephbonneau;Many people have already criticized @Zendo but here's a technical breakdown of why using one-time pads is misguided: https://t.co/RUBMhcRo0y
josephbonneau;Audio of me on @Dr_K_Albrecht show today: http://t.co/2tvBjaPMUM Is it good or bad that there's enough privacy news for a daily radio show?
josephbonneau;@ETFovac Windows 7 rejected that version (Win8 or later required). Oh well, guess my old laptop isn't cool enough for #superfish to backdoor
josephbonneau;I tried installing #superfish manually on Windows 7 for IE/Chrome/FF. No root certs added. Looks like this was only for pre-installs

josephbonneau;Agreed. I meant nothing further @kdvncm @csoghoian Institutions can be malicious without the individuals in the institution being malicious.
josephbonneau;@csoghoian I don't think that's a fair characterization of what I said, and I'm certainly not defending the NSA. I want it abolished.
josephbonneau;@csoghoian There was zero propoganda, we just had lunch and discussed research. Read my blog post, I was very clear how I feel about the NSA
josephbonneau;@fugueish They didn't tell me any stories, just engineers discussing research. I only mean it's not a place full of malicious individuals
josephbonneau;Just seeing NSA headquarters though, I don't want to live in a society where the public doesn't know what goes on in a building of that size
josephbonneau;Spending a day at the NSA, they have very impressive people who care about privacy and following the rules. Our problems are in Washington

fivefifths;@Siggihreins I’m still seeking answers myself. But I think an annual taper of payments to the fund of some amount is a good idea lol
fivefifths;I'd favor an income-generating tax-free fund with disbursements over time https://t.co/mic7KdManv
fivefifths;again, that would make this generation look wealthy on paper, but property and income generation is split for next gen &amp  degraded by debt
fivefifths;given the impact that housing discrimination and theft play in racial income disparities, I think a house-sized transfer sounds about right
fivefifths;@davidcrespo @MattBruenig haha that's fair
fivefifths;@davidcrespo well I think the income generation from the fund would be necessary to its maintenance, since the problem is generational
fivefifths;debt would. and of course a lot of most immediate liquid injections are just spent down over time naturally https://t.co/ngt09xvp3q
fivefifths;@davidcrespo you're looking at something south of a $10,000 annual disbursement per person, or about $800/month
fivefifths;@davidcrespo but there's the rub. if you take that 12.3 trillion and apply it say only over the lifetime of living black people...
fivefifths;@davidcrespo you wouldn't though, because people have children and debt
fivefifths;even if we accept that the immediate term distortion of income graphs is a real problem, you can solve it with say periodic disbursements
fivefifths;yes, a one time transfer of any amount of wealth would skew any single year over year measure of wealth. But inequality is a time series

csdoctorsister;@nxtstop1 Gr8 2 know jic. #hcldr
csdoctorsister;@nxtstop1 Thx, address my concern. I'll b asking doc 4 email. #hcldr
csdoctorsister;T2: Yes, I just don't think pats should pay copay. If I end a relationship, I'm not taking paying 4 that person's meal. #HCLDR
csdoctorsister;@PoPculture_px Point taken. Just wondered abt bigger issue of paying &amp  waiting 2 c some1 u don't want 2 pay or wait 2 c. Just curious #hcldr
csdoctorsister;@PoPculture_px good idea, but would I have 2 pay the $15/$20 co-pay &amp  wait 30 min 2 have this convo?!? #hcldr
csdoctorsister;Hi @Colin_Hung! ((waving))
csdoctorsister;Brandeis from GA, here. I've never fired a doc so I most likely will b a lurker this evening #HCLDR

csdoctorsister;Well, this was fun! Hope 2 join again - this time may be difficult due 2 work schedule moving forward #HITsm
csdoctorsister;@dz45tr Exactly. App r intended 2 augment, enhance or improve human 2 human interactions, not replace it. Remember this. #HITsm
csdoctorsister;@teedco yeah, Mac should just rule the world :-)
csdoctorsister;@unha_engels @seastarbatita We call this prototyping. Good option if clients r ok w/ incomplete software &amp  viewing new designs. #HITsm
csdoctorsister;T3: HC testing, IT testing, User testing &amp  repeat! #HITsm
csdoctorsister;@seastarbatita @Colin_Hung Time is relative. Most ppl want 2 c product. 1 week or 1 mo is rarely enough 2 understand a new domain. #HITsm
csdoctorsister;@Colin_Hung Understood. IJS ppl tend 2 want 1 app/tech 2 do everything. It's just improbable. &gt  talking = &gt  functions &amp  &lt  efficient. #HITsm
csdoctorsister;@wareFLO And those specific steps, resources &amp  goals is what varies person 2 person :-) #HITsm
csdoctorsister;@Colin_Hung Maybe, but end-users r fickle. 1 day X is important &amp  next day Y is important. Just hard 2 pinpoint high priorities. #HITsm
csdoctorsister;@dineshrs it's very hard 2 do. All stakeholders have different goals, outcomes. Must find the appropriate intersection. #HITsm
csdoctorsister;The term 'workflow' is another vague term n STEM. It's key 2 determine outcomes, then work backwards 2 decide functions. #HITsm
csdoctorsister;T1: HC IT apps r trying 2 do too much &amp  therefore not doing 1 thing well. HC is not standardizable, but apps r built 4 'norm'. #HITsm
csdoctorsister;I'm here, I'm here, I'm here...Brandeis from GA. Hello every1! #HITsm

csdoctorsister;@BrettSnodgrass1 hmmm, if HCs don't participate, then they can't complain abt bad tech. #hcldr #t4
csdoctorsister;@OchoTex @JoeBabaian HMO limitations - few choice n docs accepting new clients, etc. It's not pat-centered. It's $ driven. #hcldr

csdoctorsister;@BrettSnodgrass1 Lol! I like the humor. When u don't sleep well, everything is off. #hcldr

csdoctorsister;To consistently &amp  correctly determine relevant data is still the big hurdle. Predictive analytics is a relatively new sun-field. #HCLDR

csdoctorsister;Well, it's hard 2 own it when hc don't freely give ur EHRs. MT: @OchoTex, @JoeBabaian missing aspect=pats taking ownership of data. #hcldr

csdoctorsister;@RevAmyZ Agreed! Tech needs 2 b trustworthy and maintain focus 2 better HC impl/maintenance plan. #hcldr
csdoctorsister;T3: a combo of tech &amp  humans is the only way. Depends on pats diagnosis. Caregivers needs 2 b aware. #hcldr
csdoctorsister;@soulmirror yes, we do. IMHO more times than not, lack of $$/resources prevent adequate care #hcldr
csdoctorsister;@dlschermd Is this b/c focus &amp  attn r on only on 1 pat? #hcldr
csdoctorsister;My thoughts of reading T2 responses: Our moral compass surpasses our pocketbooks. It's a sad reality. #hcldr
csdoctorsister;T2: it's a pats right but feasibility depends on the HC impl plan. What equip? Which docs, nurses? Tele-med possible? Etc. #hcldr
csdoctorsister;@hcldr Some services r not provided if pat has assets. Pats must b dependent. It's crazy. Have nothing 2 get something. #hcldr
csdoctorsister;T1(contd): there is also all the medical jargon 2 learn, understand 2 help improve quality of life. #hcldr

csdoctorsister;@pfanderson @dz45tr I wish. Practically it makes sense. At very least, less hospital food. #hcldr

CandiceBenbow;....chile....the way these internet church mothers be in my inbox. https://t.co/ugEsoEKmjh
CandiceBenbow;May we learn to give people room to adapt/adjust to how life has changed them even when those adaptations/adjustments make us uncomfortable.
CandiceBenbow;What I care about is that I'm able to name changes in my behavior and understand where they came from. That is growth and it is progress.
CandiceBenbow;Maybe I will be somewhere else with my language this time next year- I don't know and, honestly, I don't care.
CandiceBenbow;If the worst vice I picked up coming out of these last 2 years is cussing more, then I'm okay with that.
CandiceBenbow;It won't tho. Be fucking clear about that. #seewhatididthere
CandiceBenbow;I get it. I do. I don't want this to dissolve into a respectability politics debate but I get it. We think language creates safe boundaries.
CandiceBenbow;I receive messages from older women/women in ministry saying that, as a role model, I should watch what I say and stop cussing so much.
CandiceBenbow;"To be ""grown"" and ""cool"" as a kid, I would sneak and curse but I always made it feel foreign out of my mouth because it was supposed to."
CandiceBenbow;Since birth, I wanted to be an AKA and the ones (young and old) I knew, before college, carried themselves/their speech in a regal way.
CandiceBenbow;And in church, you were taught that godly women only use godly language.
CandiceBenbow;I can count on one hand with FINGERS left the number of times in 33 years I heard my mother curse. She just didn't do it.
CandiceBenbow;"I was groomed in environments where cursing is not what polished women did. Women who are ""common"" cuss."
CandiceBenbow;"I legit cuss alot more than I ever did and I cuss publicly. She asked if this was something we wanted to work on and I said ""No. I'm good."""
CandiceBenbow;The more I've been through, the more cussing I'm doing. I talked about that with my therapist today.
CandiceBenbow;It's hard enough to navigate w/o parents. Don't make it harder by forcing us to navigate w/o folks who mean so much to us in other ways.
CandiceBenbow;Pastors, don't take our moving to different cities/churches personally. If it didn't have anything to do with you, don't make it about you.
CandiceBenbow;Many of us take pastoral relationships very seriously and it is never an easy decision to move churches.
CandiceBenbow;I can definitely relate.
CandiceBenbow;When he was battling addiction, his pastor became a dad to him and, after losing both his parents, this feels like another parental loss.
CandiceBenbow;So the pastor has literally blocked him on social media and won't return his calls/texts.
CandiceBenbow;He left the church because he moved away but the pastor felt like he still could have made the drive and was upset he chose not to do it.
CandiceBenbow;...spent the morning talking to one of my homeboys who is experiencing church hurt.

CandiceBenbow;@BEATFACEHONEY These things have nothing to do with what path you're on. They are very natural responses to pain and trauma.
CandiceBenbow;NO! This is really dangerous and not true at all. It is not biblical and is anti-Christian. https://t.co/TyFWUkY6b6

CandiceBenbow;So Blossom gotta take this L, sit TF down, shut TF up and regroup.
CandiceBenbow;The fact she allowed that to fuel a perspective that girls who are “pretty” and dress whoever TF they want are complicit in assault is foul.
CandiceBenbow;It ain’t have nothing to do with her looking awkward.
CandiceBenbow;Mayim wasn’t victimized, as a child, because she was lucky and there were protective parameters in place around her than other young girls.
CandiceBenbow;Sexual assault ain’t based on pretty privilege. It’s rooted in power and the ability to victimize and silence.
CandiceBenbow;So while we not bout to make Mayim the face of patriarchy, we ain’t bout to let her get away with saying dumb shit either.
CandiceBenbow;If your feminism includes space that holds me accountable for assault because you’re mad I’m “pretty”, fuck you and it!
CandiceBenbow;But sis ain’t said squat about his opinions like hers also enable the Weinsteins of the world.
CandiceBenbow;So she did that whole “will I raise my boys to be Harvey Weinstein?” video because...okay. I get it I guess.
CandiceBenbow;It’s like when you’re mad you ain’t a popular girl but glory in the bad things that happen to them because they wouldn’t let you be one.
CandiceBenbow;Mayim’s op-ed read like a woman who still ain’t reckoned with her ownself but secretly blames women for their victimization.
CandiceBenbow;Then you said women gotta think about how they present themselves and now you shocked at the backlash?! BYE BLOSSOM!
CandiceBenbow;You wrote a whole piece about how being less attractive kept you from being sexually assaulted. Sis SEATS.
CandiceBenbow;Mayim said exactly what she said and now wants to walk it back. Nah.
CandiceBenbow;@RachaeltheLord you are right. Rose’s tweet was trash and exposed precisely why solidarity is for White women. I love you!

CandiceBenbow;Black women are subjected to ALL manner of evil on Twitter daily and y’all act like you don’t see it. Your girl gets suspended and “REBEL!”
CandiceBenbow;Boycott if you like but at some point, I hope woke White women realize the DEEP sleep they remain in concerning Black women’s experiences.
CandiceBenbow;Trump used Twitter to attack Jemele. So telling us that boycotting Twitter in support of her wasn’t the right “platform” ain’t gon fly.
CandiceBenbow;@MsLRAlcin @ElleWCarter 💕💕
CandiceBenbow;Yep! https://t.co/xJuLTPIoIR

CandiceBenbow;We are entering the holiday season and, for many of us, that will require extra care on our part. #ChurchGirlsGetDepressedToo
CandiceBenbow;It’s not your fault. You have worth and purpose, no matter what the voices may say. #ChurchGirlsGetDepressedToo
CandiceBenbow;Asking “Why me?” “What about me?” “When will it be my turn?” are very real. #ChurchGirlsGetDepressedToo
CandiceBenbow;People say you shouldn’t compare yourself to others but we all know that’s difficult at times. #ChurchGirlsGetDepressedToo
CandiceBenbow;Sis, it’s not a soul tie. It’s heartbreak and that’s okay. #ChurchGirlsGetDepressedToo

CandiceBenbow;Nene’s comment was vile and yet, it’s interesting how it is potentially “career ending” for her and not for men who do it too.
CandiceBenbow;Shoot Def Comedy Jam Just used one of Kevin Hart’s rape jokes in their Netflix special. And he is notorious for rape jokes. Others are too.
CandiceBenbow;Interesting how Nene is getting skewered for this comment and male comedians have entire routines around rape. And no one says a word.

CandiceBenbow;There's something to be said about our generation of church girls raised by single moms who were womanish even if/when they didn't know it.
CandiceBenbow;In the early 80s, that was not what churched Black women were doing. She was supposed to be apologetic  she was not.

CandiceBenbow;When we make these kinds of reductive moves, it’s clear that we don’t know much -if anything- about mental health.

CandiceBenbow;Come, ye disconsolate... wherever ye languish.  Come to the mercy seat... fervently kneel.
CandiceBenbow;We are human and stuff hurts. Even as y’all encourage us to walk in our purposes, I hope y’all remember that too.
CandiceBenbow;I say all this to say some of us go through alot and it can be ugly. It’s unnecessarily hateful&amp you can’t always let it roll off your back.
CandiceBenbow;While I know people mean well, when you’re not in these particular positions, you often have no idea the toll it can take on you.
CandiceBenbow;And I don’t need people telling me to brush the dirt of my shoulders and let haters be my motivators.
CandiceBenbow;My friends were able to gain the vicinity where the 4:43 messages are coming from&amp blocking bigots on Twitter is the will of God for my life.
CandiceBenbow;I don’t post this looking for encouragement or advice. My circle holds me down.
CandiceBenbow;Add to that being RTd by a racist/bigot with a huge platform today and you spend all day getting called everything but a child of God.
CandiceBenbow;Just this morning, before church, I received yet another one.
CandiceBenbow;This person claims to be dude’s advocate&amp has even gon as far as to say I deserved rape&amp my mama is happy to be away from a daughter like me.
CandiceBenbow;Since writing 4:43, someone has been sending mean-spirited messages about how awful my life is&amp how amazing dude who broke my heart has it.
CandiceBenbow;When you get RTd by the cofounder of the Tea Party, expect the illiterate racists and bigots to get on your nerves all day.

CandiceBenbow;How rudimentary and nonexistent does your Christianity have to be to align with Donald Trump’s? Sis have every seat in New Members class.
CandiceBenbow;They really are perfect examples of the Black Church mean girls we grew up with and can’t stand. One just does a better job of masking it.
CandiceBenbow;@fifthpastor Did you see the video?! She’s really not bright and uses attitude to bully it off.
CandiceBenbow;I don’t cancel Black women but I sure can make the decision to never support you again.
CandiceBenbow;But most importantly, when Black Christian women tell us they voted for Trump, they’re telling us they want to be White.
CandiceBenbow;When Black Christian women tell you they voted for Trump, they are telling you they deeply lack the discernment they claim to have.
CandiceBenbow;But they are also telling you that they do not care at all about the conditions under which Black people live bc they think it’s our fault.
CandiceBenbow;When Black Christian women tell you they voted for Trump, they are first telling you that they are not smart. First and foremost.
CandiceBenbow;It didn’t matter his entire campaign was antithetical to the Gospel. All that mattered was he said he was going to put gay folk in line.
CandiceBenbow;When Christians say they voted for Trump, theyre saying it didn’t matter he stoked fires of racism, sexism, classism and ableism.
CandiceBenbow;When people say they voted for 45 bc of his Christian beliefs, what they mean is bc he opposes marriage equality&amp LGBTQ equal protections.

CandiceBenbow;In the wake of Hart conversations on blogs/social media today, I wanna publicly thank @hellonecole for showing us a better/higher way. 💕
CandiceBenbow;@GraciouslyTori 😳😳
CandiceBenbow;Church girls, we got bigger battles than suggesting God's hand is in Eniko's humiliation at the hands of the Crown Prince of F*ckboyery.
CandiceBenbow;"Somebody's ignorant ass pastor literally preached ""The Testimony of a THOT"" yesterday and used stripper pole clip art for his advertisement."
CandiceBenbow;...and we really gotta sit and deal with that.
CandiceBenbow;Some folk don't go to church because they came across some sisters who were some straight up b*tches in Jesus' name.
CandiceBenbow;Because there are some folk who aren't in church...not because of the patriarchy, evangelicalism or the church doesn't cater to millennials.
CandiceBenbow;And, in the same church cultures that we often critique, that behavior gets rewarded.
CandiceBenbow;...and we cloak our mean girlness in a churchspeak that renders us more valuable than the sisters we've discarded.
CandiceBenbow;I feel like some of us are mean girls who happen to be Christian.   We are Christian mean girls.

CandiceBenbow;And until dudes are ready to have that conversation, they can quit hashtagging Kenneka and every other sister because its clanging symbols.
CandiceBenbow;But they are just as monstrous as some of the brothers who have taken some of our sisters away.
CandiceBenbow;There are some men who will never see the inside of a prison simply because their treatment of women isn't considered criminal...
CandiceBenbow;That's why yall's men's conferences and organizations will forever be bullshit. Because all your meetings have not materialized better men.
CandiceBenbow;"But every day, we get on here and hear what's wrong with ""females""...as if we magically manifested all this pain ourselves."
CandiceBenbow;Hearts broken. Spirits crushed. Hopes and dreams dashed. Bitterness, anger, hopelessness all take root.
CandiceBenbow;...and it doesn't seem to matter until she is dead.
CandiceBenbow;At any given moment, a Black girl/woman is living with/through the brokenness cause by someone in her intimate space...
CandiceBenbow;Every 21 hours, a Black girl/woman is killed by someone who was in her intimate space...
CandiceBenbow;If you do not hold the brothers accountable for their treatment of Black girls/women and justify their behavior, you are the forces of evil.
CandiceBenbow;If you have left bodies of broken girls and women in your wake and have never apologized for the trauma you caused, Heaven is not your home.
CandiceBenbow;If your personal ethic and theology doesn't compel you to make the world better for Black girls and women, you are the AntiChrist.
CandiceBenbow;So where do we go to be free?
CandiceBenbow;We are supposed to find rest and safety in those we love. Yet, they are often the ones who cause us the most terror.
CandiceBenbow;...and I'm thinking myself and other sisters waking up everyday wiping tears, preparing to face a world that looks for ways to break us.
CandiceBenbow;...and I'm thinking about Kennedi and all our little sisters who've known heartbreak before they've gotten a chance to know themselves.
CandiceBenbow;...and thinking about Kenneka Jenkins and Jeannine Skinner who are no longer here because they trusted devils imitating angels.
CandiceBenbow;"I'm listening to Solange's ""Weary"" and wondering where do we go?"
CandiceBenbow;Where do Black girls go to be whole and safe and free?

CandiceBenbow;The question for us is what are we going to do now. I'm tired. So many of us are. White people, DO BETTER. The end.
CandiceBenbow;Black Joy is a real thing and I have experienced it through the use of many of these products.
CandiceBenbow;And it's frustrating bc beauty industry participation for many WOC is a way to maneuver antiBlackness, misogyny and homo/transantagonism.
CandiceBenbow;Until White people reckon with the ways they embody privilege and racism in all its manifestations, nothing is going to happen.
CandiceBenbow;Her comments actually DO represent the diverse opinions of people in this world and are rooted in theoretical analysis AND history.
CandiceBenbow;Add to that, L'Oréal didn't care at all what it meant to fire their first trans brand ambassador days after hiring her.

CandiceBenbow;It's wrong, period, for the church to be closed. But if it was mostly poor Black and Brown folk, folks would not care Lakewood is closed.
CandiceBenbow;Be clear: Joel Osteen and Lakewood Church were the top trending topics because White folk are stranded and need refuge.

CandiceBenbow;And if you find difference in it, it's because you don't see the oppression of Black women as equal to the oppression of Black folk.
CandiceBenbow;If you watch boxing and support Floyd, do you. Just recognize it is akin to my refusal to participate in the boycott and watching football.
CandiceBenbow;But don't be a hypocrite. Don't blast folk for not boycotting then be out here celebrating a known abuser (and All Lives Matter apologist).
CandiceBenbow;Often, our hands ain't clean simply because this world is dirty AF.
CandiceBenbow;At the same time, it's not lost on me how much of what brings me joy is bound within frameworks of racism, capitalism, sexism and the like.
CandiceBenbow;Watching football brings me joy and, as an ethic, I choose not to police how Black folk experience joy in an anti-Black world.
CandiceBenbow;I'm not boycotting football. I understand why folks are. Their choice. For me, I love football and look forward to it every year.

CandiceBenbow;R. Kelly is literally brainwashing&amp holding Black women hostage. There's deeper stuff to bothered by than a sister waiting for her husband.
CandiceBenbow;We can't celebrate and defend Amber Rose's agency and then turn around and question Yvonne's. That's really not how any of this works.
CandiceBenbow;Our fight ain't with sisters who choose to be at one end of the spectrum.
CandiceBenbow;Our criticisms should be with religious doctrines that suggest there isn't room for all of us within the faith.
CandiceBenbow;I'm honestly confused as to why folks are criticizing Yvonne Orji's choice to be a virgin.

CandiceBenbow;I wish yall could have heard how audible our disappointment was when they said Tyrese was there. 😂😂😂
CandiceBenbow;@iamLaToyaG Either way, there is NO rational explanation for that chick to have ever gotten New Destiny.
CandiceBenbow;@iamLaToyaG I'd heard that, too. I'd also read that her new church was open to combining, etc.
CandiceBenbow;@iamLaToyaG She and her husband pastored it. When he died, she should've became pastor. But some shifty sh*t went down and Paula got it.
CandiceBenbow;Chile...chickens always come home to roost even if it's on the altar.
CandiceBenbow;Because these pastors always put their desire for a closer proximity to Whiteness over/above actually caring for the Black community.
CandiceBenbow;So all these Black male pastors falling away from Paula now because she's rocking with Trump are really as trifling as she is.
CandiceBenbow;When are we going to talk about how Paula AINT NEVER HAD TO PASTOR IN A HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM AFTER BEING ON A NATIONAL PREACHING PLATFORM?!
CandiceBenbow;When are we going to be honest about how Black male pastors have given Paula more passes than they EVER gave Juanita?!
CandiceBenbow;When are we going to talk about a whole church was stolen from a Black woman so Paula could pastor it?!
CandiceBenbow;So, again I ask: when are we going to talk about Black men's infatuation with White women?
CandiceBenbow;So the Paula we see/hear now is the chick she's always been.
CandiceBenbow;"But Black male pastors would rather give a White woman who can ""sound"" Black a platform quicker than giving it to an actual sister."
CandiceBenbow;Paula White has never been here for Black people. Ever. She's always been a culture vulture.

CandiceBenbow;@WilhSlater Sis!!!
CandiceBenbow;...until then, let's do better by each other.
CandiceBenbow;...but one day we'll talk about how the most progressive/active voices around justice are often the biggest emotional terrorists.
CandiceBenbow;If you bear the image of God, I have a responsibility to treat you that way. Point blank, period.
CandiceBenbow;We can't be fully invested in justice when we are unjust to folks who have shown love/deep care.
CandiceBenbow;I can't be out here cussing you out, fighting you, causing you harm, etc and talking about how committed to justice I am.
CandiceBenbow;I had/have to work through the trauma I've experienced in intimate space because it's impacted how I respond to things.
CandiceBenbow;And you can't be fully committed to any form of justice if you're wreaking havoc in folks' intimate lives.
CandiceBenbow;How we treat people actually says everything about what we think about the Holy and the Divine.
CandiceBenbow;One of my professors said this to me yesterday and I'm stuck: every human encounter is also a sacred one.
CandiceBenbow;I just think we don't talk enough about the ethics of loving. And it's clear some of y'all are quite unethical AF.
CandiceBenbow;And be clear: new dude got checked and side eyed...because if you'll trash her, what you gon do if we break up??
CandiceBenbow;But that's just how my womanist ethics are set up. And it's clear that everybody talking about Heaven ain't going there.
CandiceBenbow;Ain't no dude I'm with ever gon trash his ex to me and I'm not going to participate in any trashing of my own.
CandiceBenbow;You ain't gotta be every Black woman's bestie to have her back.
CandiceBenbow;...and guess what?! I don't have no issues with her and she has none with me because it was never about us.
CandiceBenbow;"""How you are with me may be different but that doesn't mean she ain't telling the truth about how you were with her."""
CandiceBenbow;"New dude literally tried to trash his ex to me. I said ""Nope. Because all you gon tell me is what makes you look good not the whole truth."""
CandiceBenbow;We are the only allies we got in this love thing. Ain't no need to become enemies. ✌🏽
CandiceBenbow;That's all I got. I'm just tired of us trashing each other because this dick is slightly better than the one we broke up with last year.
CandiceBenbow;Chile...just wait. Because everything he's done to them, he WILL do to you whether you find out about it or not.
CandiceBenbow;But instead of standing with your sister, you work to trash her name because he's been good to you.
CandiceBenbow;Sis, we are literally all we got and I guarantee that if he got 1-2 RECENT broken relationships before you, he's trash personified.
CandiceBenbow;Sisters get with dudes after they have been premium fuck boys in someone else's life and act like the ex is lying/crazy.
CandiceBenbow;Someone said it perfectly to me yesterday: one of the collateral damages of BM's emotional terrorism is the impact it has on BW solidarity.
CandiceBenbow;"I need us to stop getting with ""good"" dudes and developing amnesia like we ain't dealt with trash before."
CandiceBenbow;Sis, just because he's good to you doesn't mean he wasn't trash to the one before you.

CandiceBenbow;@divafeminist How can you have a progressive theology around your own conception and parents' sexuality but not LGBTQIA  folk?!
CandiceBenbow;@divafeminist I'm not surprised but I'm disappointed because he's always been vocal about being a child of unwed, teen parents.
CandiceBenbow;@divafeminist ...and folks who were in church and watched it on the livestream took to social media about it.
CandiceBenbow;@divafeminist It's at the end of the service. It was in the context of the way our past mistakes can have future implications.

CandiceBenbow;So I'm not as much for calling Tasha out for not asking questions as much as I am side eyeing Lawrence for pretending he liked that girl.
CandiceBenbow;But niggas do that. They will exhibit all the behaviors of a dude who cares (because that's what good dudes do right?!) when they don't.

CandiceBenbow;He really thought going to that cookout when he didn't like her, then bouncing and telling her after the fact was honesty. It was trash!
CandiceBenbow;Brothers don't consistently check each other when it comes to their emotional immaturity.
CandiceBenbow;The Tashas AND Issas of the world will always have sisters in their lives to check them on their stuff. The Lawrences are a different story.

CandiceBenbow;I hope you're being patient with them and, above all else, I hope they know you love them.
CandiceBenbow;If you know people who have lost a parent (or person who raised them), I hope you are giving space/freedom to mourn/adjust to this new life.
CandiceBenbow;Right now, I'm a daughter missing her mama. Right now, I'm a child who didn't think they'd have to have everything figured out so fast.
CandiceBenbow;I believe some wounds reopen often and, if time does anything, it hopefully gives us more tools to maneuver through those instances.
CandiceBenbow;Please don't tell me it gets better with time. Please don't tell me that's how wounds heal. Because I don't believe that.
CandiceBenbow;Please don't tell me you can't imagine my pain. To me, it's actually insulting.
CandiceBenbow;Every second of every single day, I miss her. And it hurts.
CandiceBenbow;Something as simple as trying to figure out how to get new tires and a ride from the airport stings. Without her, I'm often lost.
CandiceBenbow;Whether it is needing advice, wanting to celebrate successes, wishing she could talk me through heartache, I'm reminded she's gone.
CandiceBenbow;My mother will celebrate her second birthday in Heaven on Saturday.   This world feels so big and cold and dark at times without her here.

CandiceBenbow;Ernest was selfish, raised a selfish son, left him everything and gave his daughters fears and insecurities. #QueenSugar

CandiceBenbow;@Yo_Q_Crush 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
CandiceBenbow;Finding ways to understand how we can compliment each other professionally is definitely one of them.
CandiceBenbow;There's so much about relationships that we have to unlearn in order to promote much healthier forms of intimacy.
CandiceBenbow;And while my womanism doesn't allow me to criticize BW relationship choices, I understand the costs associated with that kind of decision.
CandiceBenbow;I've seen sisters choose the route of adjusting/shaping their lives to be in relationships with men who didn't appreciate their full power.
CandiceBenbow;What I do matters too and you need to be trying to figure out how you compliment me and that work instead of assuming I will change it.
CandiceBenbow;"Now, standing in the midst of things I've prepared for my whole life, I now understand why sisters say ""I'm focused on my career."""
CandiceBenbow;Essentially, I denied my confidence to be connected with brothers who didn't know their own worth so they definitely couldn't see mine.
CandiceBenbow;And I heard that, took it to heart and tried to dumb down my own work. Stopped writing and posting things to prove I could be THAT girl.
CandiceBenbow;I was told #redliptheology makes me a dope colleague/great convo partner but not the woman who meets Mama &amp  sits on the church's second row.
CandiceBenbow;And I did that. I would do everything I could to show that his life/what he had going on mattered. I never got the same in return.
CandiceBenbow;We're taught our lives are supposed to take the shape of being helpmates and we'll be rewarded with a beautiful family.

CandiceBenbow;Any time you're tried for double murder&amp armed robbery and you say your life is conflict free, we can set the clock for your next arrest.

CandiceBenbow;I love how my grandma thinks people on her FB timeline are personally sending her every status update and post. It's hilarious.
CandiceBenbow;This man said he lived a conflict free life. Help me Holy Ghost.
CandiceBenbow;@edusankofa Thanks sis! Seriously.
CandiceBenbow;@ASIAXXIII Sis! I really came here thinking you had some better survival tips. 😂😂😂
CandiceBenbow;@edusankofa SIS!!!!!
CandiceBenbow;Chile.... https://t.co/aoHlNHBAuw
CandiceBenbow;Is this a parole hearing or a reality tv reunion show?!
CandiceBenbow;Apparently OJ ain't never seen a ceiling in his whole life either.
CandiceBenbow;"...just when I was starting to get sad, OJ came and said ""watch me make a fool of myself."""
CandiceBenbow;I will say I'm glad sisters are getting 4:43 apologies and brothers are owning their 4:43 behavior because I ain't got diddly squat.
CandiceBenbow;Just be better. Do better.
CandiceBenbow;More specifically, I appreciate hearing/seeing brothers sit with it.
CandiceBenbow;It's been really interesting to see all these 4:43 discussions in so many different spaces.
CandiceBenbow;Listen and subscribe!! https://t.co/iBlruEDcKy
CandiceBenbow;Listening to @BrunchCulture discuss 4:43 on their podcast! Dope and hilarious discussion! Thanks so much y'all! Really appreciate it!!
CandiceBenbow;Pray they're given enough to make it through the night &amp  we'll be equipped with whatever they'll need when the sun comes up in the morning.
CandiceBenbow;Pray that God sends a clear message of how much they are loved and matter.
CandiceBenbow;When you pray tonight, whisper a pray for people who feel hopeless.
CandiceBenbow;I still think that, in some ways...which is why the show's turn (or lack thereof) in terms of MJ's growth is something I gotta sit with.
CandiceBenbow;I came out the gate season 1 saying BMJ was the most authentic representation of single prof Black women's struggles across the board.
CandiceBenbow;Maybe the show is supposed to be a mirror of sorts. And, if that's the case, well...ouch.
CandiceBenbow;Being Mary Jane has become disappointing. No growth. MJ's still making the same dumb love/relationship mistakes. But maybe that's the point.

CandiceBenbow;"It's been hilarious the folk doing ""but y'all don't even support Black businesses"" talk post 4:44 like they ain't peddling pyramid schemes."
CandiceBenbow;The fact that nobody woke me up to see Sir and Rumi is proof positive I love y'all more than y'all love me.
CandiceBenbow;Know who THEY are and who YOU are. Be humble but also be wise.
CandiceBenbow;Last thing: Everybody ain't got the seat at the table they say they have. Some folks are waiting to ride your wave right into the room.
CandiceBenbow;We are all entertaining angels unaware. There is genuine beauty and power in supporting each other.
CandiceBenbow;We can't get so haughty that we look down on folks who are on the very same road we once traveled.
CandiceBenbow;They are building their dreams and need our support.
CandiceBenbow;But I say this to say many of us are in the presence of some amazing creatives who are literally on the ground floor of their greatness.
CandiceBenbow;...and to be clear, I'm not saying this to assert some level of arrival because I have not.

CandiceBenbow;The conversations I've had with brothers in response to 4:43 make it clear many are groping for language and accountability.
CandiceBenbow;It really would be dope if some forums on Black male vulnerability happened in conjunction with the 4:44 Tour.

CandiceBenbow;@blkhlthcreative I think there's a cost either way.
CandiceBenbow;Freedom has never been free.

CandiceBenbow;And trust that, eventually, we will be okay. Because we will.
CandiceBenbow;We've got to keep trusting and stay on the path, take the hits, feel them and readjust when necessary.
CandiceBenbow;At the same time, though, I do believe the Universe has a way of ensuring that you always end up exactly where you need to be.

CandiceBenbow;God. https://t.co/XlM2Wc7nJh
CandiceBenbow;@knottypoet Thank you Sis. So much.
CandiceBenbow;Focus on helping folk heal FIRST. if forgiveness comes let it come. But don't force it or make it mandatory for flourishing. That's demonic.
CandiceBenbow;God ain't thinking about me forgiving dude and as much as dude coming to God himself for forgiveness.
CandiceBenbow;God is much more invested in the work I am doing to live and be whole in this world. THAT is where God's concern is.
CandiceBenbow;If I never forgive my rapist (and forgiving him ain't even on my radar), I believe God understands the weight of such an action is too much.
CandiceBenbow;God wants them well. Point blank. Period.
CandiceBenbow;I think healing is necessary to forgive but stop telling people they need to forgive in order to heal first. That's a lie.
CandiceBenbow;What do you think matters more to God: healing from trauma so you can flourish or forgiving your rapist/abuser/deadbeat parent? Seriously?
CandiceBenbow;Too often in church we hear: if you don't forget, God ain't gon forgive you...using really poor exegesis of the text and no common sense.
CandiceBenbow;Healing vs Forgiveness: There is a difference between being asked to forgive minor offenses and those that change the course of a life.
CandiceBenbow;@SexceeOnassis Yes. I actually don't focus on forgiveness as much if at all in my work. I think healing is more important.

CandiceBenbow;Yes, which is why work has to be done to believe differently. It took me a while to get there. #443Chat https://t.co/laZg28rkCH
CandiceBenbow;@FairyDustBeccs I just think Black women were created for more than to just be the helpers of men. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;@FairyDustBeccs Now, don't get me wrong, I think partnerships should be constructed how partners choose. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;"@FairyDustBeccs I have always struggled with ""helpmate"" language especially when there are biblical examples of women who led. #443Chat"
CandiceBenbow;@FairyDustBeccs But did God create us for strategy though? Or were we created to live fully into the lives of our making? #443Chat

CandiceBenbow;"So many want folks to ""get over"" heartbreak Easter Sunday style as if Good Friday pain and Holy Saturday grief never happened. #443Chat"
CandiceBenbow;Inherent in healing is naming a pain and all the ways that pain affects you. If that happens in health, why not spiritually? #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;I didn't expect for 4:43 to do what it has done but I'm grateful. Too many people are hurting in silence bc we won't let them hurt. #443Chat

CandiceBenbow;Q9: Yea, I still love the dummy! LOL I wrote 4:43 from that place. I don't apologize for that nor am I ashamed. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q9: We gotta quit telling folk love/growth/healing is worth painful processes. Often, it's not. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q9: We must stop romanticizing pain to inspire people to love again. Black people live with/in pain daily. Love should be refuge. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q9: After heartbreak, we're often scared OF love and TO love The potential of hurt is great. I never want to feel this again. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q9: I hope to be loved as well as I love. I hope I'm able to fearlessly love again. Because that's the other side of this... #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q9: 4:43 just allowed me to speak the depths of my truth so I could face it and find deeper ways to live into full love. #443Chat

CandiceBenbow;...this gif gets me every time! https://t.co/wF9QM4pfpi
CandiceBenbow;@Jessica_Jamese I honestly don't think so. I've become more invested in healing FIRST and then making decisions from healed places. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;@sunnydaejones LOLOL
CandiceBenbow;Q8: But who wants to be lonely, right?! So we sacrifice and become more broken than before. That ain't love OR life. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q8: If we're sacrificing for love in diminishing ways, we're negating the goodness of our creation. That is sin. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q8: I think love is work. But we can't sacrifice ourselves. We are good creation. Everything about us. God/Spirit says so. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q8: We've been taught love has to cost us something painful in order to get to the beautiful. I used to believe that. Not anymore. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;@sunnydaejones So that may not work with someone else. But, for them, the work is ongoing to be a healthy union. I respect that. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;@sunnydaejones I also think it matters to acknowledge that the growth he has done/is doing meets their relationship requirements. #443Chat

CandiceBenbow;Q7: Do what will ensure YOU get good rest at night and make sure you're being loved every step of the way. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q7: Full love can look like reconciling w/a partner, moving forward in a new relationship or remaining single to work on yourself. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q7: No one can say what is right for a life they're not living. Our responsibility is to remind folk that they deserve full love. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q7: I never give relationship advice. My position is to support whatever decision you make, trusting you know what's best for you. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q7: We live in an age where our lives are public fodder and too many make decisions accordingly for fear of what folk will say. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q7: At the same time, if you deeply love someone but know that staying would be dehumanizing, you need to leave. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q7: If you deeply love someone and you are BOTH willing to do the work to restore the relationship, you should do it. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q7: It can look like both. I caught lots of heat from sisters bc 4:43 makes clear my feelings at the moment. But it's where *I* am. #443Chat

CandiceBenbow;Q6: I love Black men and believe they love us. I want them to do better. And from the responses, they seem to be getting that. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q6: I didn't write 4:43 from a space of anger. Quite the opposite, it was written from a space of deep love. #443Chat

CandiceBenbow;Q4: We're taught that forgiveness is most important. But that's not true. Healing is. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q4: It leads to being overly gracious and forgiving hoping one day God AND men will honor our faithfulness. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q4: Women are constantly groomed to be humble/forgiving because that's what God wants us to be. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q4: In church, we're taught the prize of being a good woman is getting the family on the front of the church fan. We want that. #443Chat

CandiceBenbow;...yes! https://t.co/Dv7Edhjcqw
CandiceBenbow;Q3: Artists create from experiences. The fact we can't allow that to be true of Bey says everything about us and nothing about her. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q3: Also, Beyoncé as an artist is the site of so much conversation and dissection that people intentionally forget she is human. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q3: Lemonade gimmick talk is no different than hearing a man is trifling and trying to find out why the sister made him that way. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q3: Black folk have always gone to great lengths to protect Black men and justify actions at the expense of sisters. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q3: It's definitely unfair but speaks to the ways we negate/silence Black women's experiences. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q3: Many wanted Jay to clap back but got admission instead. What  does it mean when we need men to cosign our pain to make it true? #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;"@UnfitChristian ""You matured faster than me. I wasn't ready"" ain't a lie. It's slightly become doctrine for us."
CandiceBenbow;"@UnfitChristian It's actually why critiques of ""It took him 47yrs! Why did she stay?!"" lacked nuance."
CandiceBenbow;@UnfitChristian So it becomes okay for a man to jump from relationship to relationship until he figures it out. But… https://t.co/6044tGZfFm
CandiceBenbow;"@UnfitChristian I think it has alot to do with a prevailing belief that men need to ""find"" themselves and women need to be ""found""."
CandiceBenbow;Q2: Often we're too busy blaming people for the pain they feel instead of sitting with them in/through it. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q2: I honestly don't think we spend enough time dealing with the repercussions of the imbalance in love. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q2: It's been interesting to hear sisters say 4:43 chronicles all the relationships of their adult life. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q2: In a strange way, 4:43 became a letter to the brokenness in him that found brokenness in me and created even more of it. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;"Q2: Like...why am I crying through ""Legacy"", looking a whole mess! LOL! I needed to gather my own self. #443Chat"
CandiceBenbow;Q2: It became what I needed to say to move out of this moment. My reaction to 4:44 showed me I wasn't beyond the hurt. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q2: I've known what it's like to be at 4:43 but this is about a man I fearlessly loved. He's the only man I ever loved like that. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q1: At the end of the day, it's my story so I put it on my blog. I didn't expect this response at all. But heartbreak is universal. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q1: So I wrote it and just kept sitting with it. I thought I'd pitch it but didn't want anyone to cut the word size or my voice. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q1: At the same time, I couldn't listen to it w/o feeling heavy. Then it hit me: I'm sad bc I want this and ain't getting it. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q1: I'd been approached by a few outlets to do a 4:44 review but felt like that should be the work of Black men. #443Chat
CandiceBenbow;Q1: Short answer: HEYELL NO! LOLOLOL #443Chat

CandiceBenbow;In Sep, I told my therapist I felt like I was drowning. April, I said it felt like I was on sand. Today, I feel like I'm on solid ground.
CandiceBenbow;There was a time when missing Mama and something overwhelming happening to me would have sent me back in a dark place.
CandiceBenbow;"I got overwhelmed/began to cry. Bawling. Cop was like ""are you serious"" He didn't give me a ticket just so I'd stop crying&amp he could leave. 😂"
CandiceBenbow;30mins later, I got pulled over. I didn't know reg expired. I told him my mother handled all the car stuff and I thought I was on top of it.
CandiceBenbow;Story Time:  Today I got exciting news! I called family/friends&amp had deep joy! It stung bc Mama isn't present but I was still excited/joyful.

CandiceBenbow;Because there would be no 4:44 without them and that's really a damn shame.
CandiceBenbow;So when y'all get done celebrating the growth, I hope y'all can spend a little time thinking about the women who are on the underside of it.
CandiceBenbow;I'm tired of being caught between wishing love didn't hurt and praying the pain was productive.
CandiceBenbow;I'm tired of waiting for the 4:44s that will never come and being embarrassed for secretly hoping that they are.
CandiceBenbow;And I'm tired.
CandiceBenbow;the folks who told me I gave too much away instead of holding the ones who took it accountable.
CandiceBenbow;the efforts that were never matched, the investments that never saw a return...
CandiceBenbow;...because I will be honest: all I did today was think about the apologies I've never received...
CandiceBenbow;However, given the number of fraternity chapters/lodges/men's ministries/pick up games/barbershops, we should be able to see some fruits.
CandiceBenbow;I'm not saying brothers aren't doing the work...
CandiceBenbow;I hope, after all is said and done, Black men find more substantive ways to show the women who love them better treatment.

CandiceBenbow;Parenthood is such a strong theme in Lemonade and 4:44. So beautiful.
CandiceBenbow;Some of the same dudes who are eating 444 up were the VERY same ones who ripped Lemonade apart and called it a gimmick.
CandiceBenbow;When you realize Jay gave Kim a second chance on the same album his mother tells her truth and she still doing that mess of a conference...

CandiceBenbow;@Duanecia I was trying to figure out why I had the visceral reaction to this that I'm having. And I had to realize… https://t.co/OkWWHHaZFG
CandiceBenbow;...great album, though.
CandiceBenbow;But they didn't. And then he left us to go and be better for someone else.
CandiceBenbow;We got and fell in love with Jigga, stayed around while he was Hov, hoping and praying things would change.
CandiceBenbow;Because, for as amazing an album it is, when some of us really sit with it, we are haunted by the reality that we will never see this Jay.
CandiceBenbow;And I'm holding all the sisters whose didn't really close right now.
CandiceBenbow;All of them loves don't make it, though.
CandiceBenbow;Not just in Jay and Bey, but we've seen it in our families, communities, churches. We've seen it in ourselves. I'm glad those loves survive.
CandiceBenbow;And when they make it, they can change the world. We're seeing that right now.
CandiceBenbow;I believe all love takes work but I believe some loves are so powerful and magical that it takes deep effort to get to the other side.
CandiceBenbow;I'm happy for all my sisters who experienced reconciliation and are in much healthier spaces with the ones they love.
CandiceBenbow;Miscarriages. Blank stares. Soulless bodies. Robbed of time and hope. Broken. The cost is too high. It's just too much.
CandiceBenbow;The cost of loving like we do. Loving men who ain't ready or willing to be loved like that.
CandiceBenbow;Loving him almost killed her. As it has almost killed so many of us. Sometimes, it does kill us.
CandiceBenbow;Amazing art does that. Vulnerability/honesty do that. Having work so powerfully invade your space&amp make you confront yourself will do that.
CandiceBenbow;I wanted to hear 4:44 in communion with Lemonade. Listening that way, something broke in me.
CandiceBenbow;That Kardashian line is NOT real. #JayZ444 #444

CandiceBenbow;and  You stare blankly into space thinking about all the time you wasted on all this basic shit.
CandiceBenbow;and  because I fall short of what I say I'm all about, your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed.
CandiceBenbow;and  I apologize because, at your best, your love
CandiceBenbow;I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions because I was emotionless.
CandiceBenbow;That's the sad truth. https://t.co/EwQwesLFKP

CandiceBenbow;@akdimiele Yea. I'm still sitting with it myself. There's a certain power that comes with being the beginning and the end of a thing.
CandiceBenbow;@nc_clair Man!! I've been thinking about how that darkness has always been the ripeness of the otherwise.
CandiceBenbow;@akdimiele That doesn't at all solve the problem. It only, to me, makes the problem seem less problematic.

CandiceBenbow;No. I had Chaps. Tell me!!! https://t.co/4o8U0ZBwCQ
CandiceBenbow;How long has Genesis known that it is not the beginning? How tired is Creation from chasing its mother self?
CandiceBenbow;"Was that why that Blackness, created by God, had to become reduced to ""nothing"" in order for God to *create* the ""real world""?"
CandiceBenbow;Was that where God's creation of Blackness lived and reigned and showed the power and potential of otherwise living?
CandiceBenbow;What exactly was the darkness that covered the face of the Deep in Genesis 1:2 and why did it need to be regulated?
CandiceBenbow;We need a doctrine of creation that isn't predicated on an insider/outsider divide.
CandiceBenbow;and restricts our language and thinking capacities to even conceptualize a world outside of that one.

CandiceBenbow;Y'all told us to let the system play out...and apparently, what it got wrong yesterday, it got right less than 24 hours later.
CandiceBenbow;...and that this was only happening because he was trying to buy NBC (which was proven MULTIPLE times to be untrue).
CandiceBenbow;And some of y'all kept running around here talking about the plight to destroy the Black man...
CandiceBenbow;This man, when deposed years ago, ADMITTED to drugging women and having sex with them unconscious. He. Actually. Said. He. Did. This.
CandiceBenbow;If you're angry about the Philando verdict and celebrating the Cosby mistrial, you are double minded and unstable in all of your ways.

CandiceBenbow;@courtneymt_ ...and if ever we have seen people lack ethics in loving, it is them.
CandiceBenbow;@courtneymt_ It's easy to. I've done it. But I honestly feel like male preachers are some of the most manipulative people on earth.
CandiceBenbow;@courtneymt_ Stay. Away. From. Pastors. And. Preachers. They are literally the worst human beings ever.
CandiceBenbow;Basically, dudes just need to do better and y'all need to do better about holding each other accountable.   That's all I got today.
CandiceBenbow;"So women are/become a site for men rooted in patriarchy (even the progressive ones) to ""work out their soul's salvation."" Yuck."
CandiceBenbow;And then, in future relationships, we celebrate the growth of men like the one she's referring to in that article.
CandiceBenbow;"And women's responses are met with ""don't become jaded or bitter"" or, in religious spaces, ""God had to send you through that in order to..."""
CandiceBenbow;And pieces like hers show how men align themselves to always prosper and take no losses or accept accountability despite trash behavior.
CandiceBenbow;In that way, loving becomes a female project that edifies man.
CandiceBenbow;I also feel patriarchal/heteronormative structures enable such a lack of ethical loving to benefit men (of course).
CandiceBenbow;How do we honor our God(s), the work of creation and dishonor human intimacy at the same?
CandiceBenbow;Do our selfish desires override discernment and our imperative to treat people well?
CandiceBenbow;I find myself, often, asking how one can truly be connected to the Divine and treat people this way.
CandiceBenbow;She doesn't name that here but as I read, I thought about how people experience this behavior from folk steeped in faith/spirituality.
CandiceBenbow;And though there are broader implications, for me, I'm thinking about it within a religious context.
CandiceBenbow;Has someone done work around the ethics of loving and being in intimate relationship?

CandiceBenbow;"I remember when I went to her live ""Lifeclass"" in St. Louis. Changed my whole life."

CandiceBenbow;States rely so much on prison labor, it's sickening. https://t.co/6ydtejgAaF
CandiceBenbow;and if prison labor is immoral at the governor's mansion, it's immoral everywhere- including the spaces that make life's mundanity possible.
CandiceBenbow;...but I can also recognize how it's easy for lefties/progressives/White liberals to pounce on that because they can't stand HRC anyway...
CandiceBenbow;"So yea I can read that HRC piece and be like ""girl...GIRL"" while also realizing that's one facet of how pervasive the PIC is in global life."
CandiceBenbow;"We don't even realize how we justify and support prison culture/nation throughout daily actions bc its existence is so vital to our ""agency"""
CandiceBenbow;It's the way prison itself is created to provide us with a (false) sense of normalcy and safety.
CandiceBenbow;It's not just the tangible companies/products/projects/etc that we support and consume that rely on prison labor (tho that's important)...
CandiceBenbow;...and that's how massive and pervasive this monster is. We demonize HRC while living lives maintained through prison labor.
CandiceBenbow;"Still, this is becoming ""Ooh look how bad HRC is"" and not ""The whole system is guilty as hell."""
CandiceBenbow;It definitely doesn't make it right. Be clear about that.

CandiceBenbow;Yes. Even now, I have to speak over myself when I begin to believe the lies. https://t.co/zKy2HX6Dsc
CandiceBenbow;@CandyCornball ...and to me, too.
CandiceBenbow;...and you can too!
CandiceBenbow;So, while there is alot in my life that isn't good right now, today I'm celebrating the fact that 6yrs ago, I walked away and kept walking.
CandiceBenbow;I pray we heal and become well.
CandiceBenbow;I would love to tell you I pray for him. Chile...I don't. LOL! i pray for us: the ones who have been hurt and have to heal.
CandiceBenbow;And then get help. Seek counseling. Go to therapy. Six years later, I'm realizing I still haven't fully healed from things he said to me.
CandiceBenbow;Talk to your parents, friends, loved ones. And get away. Seriously.
CandiceBenbow;I used to think it wasn't bad because he wasn't hitting me and every day wasn't a bad day. But I was being abused and deserved better.
CandiceBenbow;To anyone who is in an emotionally abusive relationship, please know that you are worth more than what you're being given right now.
CandiceBenbow;Things ain't all good. Heartbreak came again. But, today, I can say that I'm proud of myself for having the courage to walk away from him.
CandiceBenbow;So, though so much has happened in my life in these past 6 years that hurt, today I thank God I had the strength to walk away from him.
CandiceBenbow;He told me I'm the kind of woman men look past waiting for something better. I cringe sometimes when I think what I believe/took from him.
CandiceBenbow;His words and actions have stayed with me. They carried over into relationships after him. And he was never worth it.
CandiceBenbow;I hope he's a better dude to his fiance. The fact that he could find humor in and the need to joke about my singleness says he's not.
CandiceBenbow;Then I had to remember how God saved me from him. Literally delivered me from the hands of the enemy.
CandiceBenbow;And for a split second, he almost got to me. I almost began to feel bad about still being single while he's about to get married.
CandiceBenbow;I mean...he is still a Grade-A asshole.
CandiceBenbow;Dude, however, is still a jerk. We ran into each other a few months back and we gloried in the fact he's engaged and I'm still single.
CandiceBenbow;Professionally, I have done well and better than if I had stayed in that program with folks who didn't believe in me or my work.
CandiceBenbow;I left that program, went to Duke and then PTS. It felt good to tell my former advisor that I'd done well after he told me I wouldn't.
CandiceBenbow;Movers were at my townhouse by the time I flew back home. Mama told me ain't no man or piece of paper worth my peace.
CandiceBenbow;I remember flying home crying and telling my mama everything: this program is horrible and this man is evil. I want to come home.
CandiceBenbow;When I got the courage to leave, I was so embarrassed. What are people at home going to think? I'm leaving a PhD program. I have failed.
CandiceBenbow;People often ignore the impact emotional and verbal abuse have because it doesn't leave visible scars.
CandiceBenbow;i hid so much from my mama and friends. But, they knew. You can only hid so much.
CandiceBenbow;...when he called, I came. Whatever he wanted, I gave it to him. All while he was telling me I was worthless.
CandiceBenbow;...and this was the dude I was trying to make love me. The dude who told me nobody would care about me more than him.
CandiceBenbow;He told me the only good thing I had going for myself was that I could write well and in print, no one would have to look at me.
CandiceBenbow;I remember dude called me weak and unlovable. He told me I wasn't worth shit, it was my fault my dad was absent and I would never be loved.
CandiceBenbow;It is not worth the pain of trying to make people love you who have decided to hate you.
CandiceBenbow;I just said that to say: Go where you are and can be loved. Personally. Professionally. Spiritually. Physically. Emotionally. Financially.
CandiceBenbow;It's been interesting to see how my life has changed in these 6yrs. Moving back was the single most defining moment of my life at the time.
CandiceBenbow;I'm glad I had a mama who told me that I could always come home when I told her that I'd made a huge mistake.
CandiceBenbow;It has taken (is still taking) me years to heal from that experience.
CandiceBenbow;6yrs ago today, I moved back to NC after moving across the country to pursue a PhD in a program I hated and be w/an abusive man.
CandiceBenbow;There is hope. There is always hope.
CandiceBenbow;I spent the past few days wondering if I'll ever get married/become a mom. Then I spent yesterday w/couples and saw Halle is pregnant...

CandiceBenbow;May we remember that on days when the enemy would dare to make us believe a lie.
CandiceBenbow;Things may hurt. They may even knock us off course. But it does not and will never overrule the freedom we have in Jesus.
CandiceBenbow;There is no power or force or experience that will ever be able to bind us when God has freed us.
CandiceBenbow;Today was a day I needed to be reminded that I have been set free and whom the Son sets free is, indeed, without chains.

CandiceBenbow;It doesn't help to be told that however you choose to heal further endangers other women. And it wasn't your fault to begin with.
CandiceBenbow;Even in how we try to comfort sexual assault victims, we need to be careful not to perpetuate even more shame.
CandiceBenbow;I was scared to report for a lot of reasons. Some of them, I own. Some of them aren't mine.
CandiceBenbow;"I've had folks ask me ""why was he in your house? Where was your discernment? Have you not been praying?"" It hurt and is hard to ignore."
CandiceBenbow;And also, in 2017, we really don't make it easy for women to come forward about assault.
CandiceBenbow;It's not my responsibility to make sure my rapist doesn't rape anyone else. It's his and his alone.
CandiceBenbow;Mostly, this has come from the men in my life who love me. I get they want to protect me. But still.
CandiceBenbow;"But I kinda get pissed when people say to me, ""what about your responsibility to other women? What if he does this to someone else?"""
CandiceBenbow;On some level, I still blame myself and am working through it.
CandiceBenbow;I had my reasons for not reporting/calling the police. Admittedly, they were rooted in fear and my own shame for inviting him into my home.
CandiceBenbow;I chose not to report my sexual assault (dude has since been arrested for something else) but I've grown tired of folks telling me I'm wrong

CandiceBenbow;"""God don't want no coward soldiers.""- #WhatTheyTaughtMeInMyLiturgylessTraditionThatPreferredExperienceOverScriptureTheyHadToBeReadInto"
CandiceBenbow;If you can't recognize that, in this time, we need to be equipped with various ways to affirm and protect all people, what God do you serve?
CandiceBenbow;Nevertheless, this ain't an argument over academic freedom. It's about the humanity and dignity of all peoples.
CandiceBenbow;...and yet, I understand it's par for the course of being a Black academic.
CandiceBenbow;It's been hard to see faculty I care about get dragged because they care about humanity.
CandiceBenbow;Critiques of *how* diversity/inclusion training works aside, the moment we negate the need to learn about others, we blaspheme the Divine.
CandiceBenbow;That means we must interrogate the ways we do not affirm/live into that.
CandiceBenbow;The aim of Christian theological education, I believe, should strive towards teaching us how to do life together.
CandiceBenbow;Any theological professor/Christian intellectual who says diversity/inclusion has no place in theology doesn't know Jesus.
CandiceBenbow;Taking my Duke Div education (in/out of class seriously), I was equipped with the resources necessary to do the work of liberation.
CandiceBenbow;Yet, while at Duke Div, I was given the best tools necessary to critique the racist theological underpinnings of American Christianity.
CandiceBenbow;That these experiences were at Div School are, both, extremely disheartening and indicative of how 45 could be beloved by White Christians.
CandiceBenbow;And while at Duke, I had countless encounters with racism and intersectional oppression.
CandiceBenbow;"I went to Duke with no illusions that this place was designed for/cared about me. It is called ""the plantation"", after all."
CandiceBenbow;I also believe that giants die and want to be a part of the work that challenges Seminary students to walk away from oppressive theologies.
CandiceBenbow;That is possible. It really is.
CandiceBenbow;Committed to theological education, I hope I will embody the kind of scholarship that reflects God's intention for creation.
CandiceBenbow;Sometimes, I feel like that narrative from the student/alumni perspective gets lost or is not present.
CandiceBenbow;It's not the blatant racism of days old but something more seductive, covert and dangerous.
CandiceBenbow;My experience at Duke could really be summed up as an experience with liberal and Evangelical White people who don't think they're racist.
CandiceBenbow;...another one said slavery provided employment and salvation for Africans that they would have otherwise been denied.
CandiceBenbow;"Once, a White classmate said Howard Thurman needed to be ""disciplined"" against the church fathers before his work could be validated."
CandiceBenbow;"...or asking the question, ""What is the merit of faith traditions that value experience over scripture?"""
CandiceBenbow;"Racism comes in the form of questioning the legitimacy of faith traditions because they are not tethered to ""liturgy""."
CandiceBenbow;"Yet, I do think it's important it's come to the ""light"" because of how covert, seductive and sophisticated racism is among White Christians."
CandiceBenbow;So, when I hear that professors are against diversity/inclusion as a matter of academic freedom, I'm not surprised. At all.
CandiceBenbow;I got my MDiv from Duke Div. My time there was so formational to my understanding of how pervasive racism is within American Christianity.
CandiceBenbow;...looking for an affordable quality hair connect...or someone to pay for these bundles...
CandiceBenbow;There's so much pain in this world, personal and collective. Too much. May we find more ways to heal and love each other. Goodnight. 💕

CandiceBenbow;@AudraSunshine I think there are some things that are not good and are evil that don't get redeemed.
CandiceBenbow;@AudraSunshine I hear you. I think we trivialize that, too.
CandiceBenbow;The church is imperfect. So are millennials. We meet at the foot of the cross together. And we need each other.
CandiceBenbow;Church folk have saved my life these last two years. I mean that.
CandiceBenbow;...and I say this as someone who recognizes that if it were not for church folk praying and caring for me, I literally would not be here.
CandiceBenbow;I say this as someone who cut my professional writing teeth critiquing/picking apart the Black Church...
CandiceBenbow;Also let me say: I get the millennial vs church critique. At the same time, I hope we can learn the ways in which church life matters.
CandiceBenbow;Again, may not be your process. But it is mine.
CandiceBenbow;"Still, part of my healing has included asking of myself, ""What have you lost and, of that, what did you actually need to lose?"""
CandiceBenbow;"And I struggle with how ""all things work together"" for my good. I believe some things cannot be redeemed in the way we think that means."
CandiceBenbow;I don't want to justify hurt or the things that have happened to me. Be clear. I never want to do that.
CandiceBenbow;I don't want to remain in the wilderness -so to speak- but I do want to keep before me the lessons I am learning in this place.
CandiceBenbow;"Warsan Shire prays, ""if it will keep my heart soft, break my heart every day."" I don't know if I share this prayer but I understand it."
CandiceBenbow;This wilderness that signifies death in all its forms somehow does not consume me but works to make me new that I might live again.
CandiceBenbow;...and yet, it has been in this space of no control that I wonder if I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.
CandiceBenbow;Every kind of death has found me and forced itself into my life in ways that stripped me from the control over my life I thought I had.
CandiceBenbow;I don't have the answers. I have just been thinking about all the ways I have been unmade in these last 2 years.
CandiceBenbow;When we are unmade, when we lose sovereignty and enter the wilderness, perhaps- that's when we really begin to live.
CandiceBenbow;I think there is a holiness in being unmade. I cannot yet articulate it but I think there is.
CandiceBenbow;...but yet, you do not die. Death surrounds you but it does not win.
CandiceBenbow;...the process of being unmade-of relinquishing sovereignty and acknowledging the vulnerability of your self to the powers that index death.
CandiceBenbow;While I will never believe that it is God's will that we experience certain unspeakable horrors, I wonder if the process can still be holy.
CandiceBenbow;Yet, I wonder if that is who God means for us to be.
CandiceBenbow;We desire for self possession. It's seductive. And for marginalized folks, it matters to be able to name and hold yourself for yourself.
CandiceBenbow;"I've been thinking a lot about how I have become ""unmade""...in a sense, losing the sovereignty that I thought I had over myself."
CandiceBenbow;"As I'm working through my stuff towards healing, I keep thinking about what it theologically means to ""consent not to be a single being""..."

CandiceBenbow;I will never buy another thing out of Hair Xpo again and we need to own more beauty supply stores ourselves.
CandiceBenbow;The fact he could put his hands on her and defend it even after learning he was wrong is just crazy.
CandiceBenbow;I have been shopping at Hair Xpo since July 2015. I can't tell you how many times that sensor has gone off on me and they just waved me out.
CandiceBenbow;"The store owner defended himself saying ""The sensor doesn't lie. They do."" The officer reiterated that the woman didn't steal anything."
CandiceBenbow;The police came, determined that the woman did not steal anything and reprimanded the store owner for putting his hands on the woman.
CandiceBenbow;Apparently, because the sensor went off, the store owner accused the woman of stealing and grabbed her. It got ugly.
CandiceBenbow;So I just left Hair Xpo (beauty supply store) in Trenton. I walk in as a sister is walking out and she is HOT. I walk in to see the police.

CandiceBenbow;Sexuality is a creation of God. I believe it bears God's image no matter how much we try to distort it.
CandiceBenbow;OMG. https://t.co/kLriCy9KrI
CandiceBenbow;There is absolutely nothing someone else can demonize for me that I have affirmed for myself and in a consensual relationship.
CandiceBenbow;This is why I and others work to encourage sisters to develop healthy sexualities for themselves.

CandiceBenbow;Specifically, she told me I'm leading Black women to Hell.
CandiceBenbow;Right after that, a sister sends me an email and it's clear she's a HLstan saying that my view of sexuality and salvation is demonic.
CandiceBenbow;Somebody sent me this conversation where they asked Heather Lindsay if oral sex is a sin. She said she&amp her spouse believe it's unclean.

CandiceBenbow;It looks impossible but I know I will make it. And so will you.   There is grace in the dust for us.
CandiceBenbow;It would've made an already excruciating  experience much worse. Yet now, I get to survey the landscape- though destroyed- with new vision.
CandiceBenbow;While I knew nothing would ever be the same once Ma passed, there are some things I would not have been capable of dealing with last year.
CandiceBenbow;Maybe we don't thank God enough for the dust. We don't recognize the inability to see the full scope of a thing all at once as God's care.
CandiceBenbow;Yet, there is something oddly inspiring about it all. I *get* to construct a new life and way forward.
CandiceBenbow;And at the same time, aspects of this year are uniquely difficult. I can *see* things. I know what has been broken and what cannot be fixed.
CandiceBenbow;Last year was completely about survival- how (or if) I would make it. If I can make it through 2016, I can make it through anything.

CandiceBenbow;"Uncle Gary would've squinted them eyes in those glasses, rolled that tongue&amp said ""see this ain't the right card cause look here it say.."""
CandiceBenbow;PWC was wrong and so were Warren and Faye. Folks had ONE job. One.
CandiceBenbow;Mistakes happen and yet you DON'T have to read a card announcing the winner for Best Actress when you're presenting Best Picture.
CandiceBenbow;If they said Uncle Gray from Chicago was backstage flipping through the announcement cards &amp  put them back wrong, I'd actually believe it. 😂
CandiceBenbow;Trump bout to have a field day with this. Yall was talking cash trash about me all night about me doing my job and yall can't do yours. 😂😂😂
CandiceBenbow;The way I just hollered. https://t.co/x1TejeDtQ2
CandiceBenbow;Warren did that whole We Shall Overcome Easter speech intro and then messed up royally. That's why God told Jordan Peele to do #GetOut.
CandiceBenbow;Did y'all see Samuel L. Jackson crying?! JESUS. WHOOOOO THIS IS MAJOR!!!!
CandiceBenbow;OH MY GOD.
CandiceBenbow;YOU ARE KIDDING ME?!?!
CandiceBenbow;Every time Moonlight wins something, I tear up a little.
CandiceBenbow;Uncle Gary from Chicago said he was gon do his part to make sure Black History Month 2017 goes out on top!
CandiceBenbow;Jimmy: I feel like you're ignoring the White celebrities.   Gary: I am.   I. Screamed.
CandiceBenbow;Who Uncle Gary is that?! He is KILLING me! 😂😂😂
CandiceBenbow;...my fortune of the week... https://t.co/MTZXSwek3P
CandiceBenbow;#GetOut captures White liberalism PERFECTLY.
CandiceBenbow;😂😂😂 https://t.co/RvIQY7LnIs
CandiceBenbow;@boomer4568 nope 😂😂😂
CandiceBenbow;Black folk went through too much in 2016 for her not to give Meek one of them 8 day passes Toya was giving her man. #sheETHER

CandiceBenbow;@comcastcares @XFINITY @comcast ...and how do you not have that information readily available?! This is ridiculous.
CandiceBenbow;@comcastcares @XFINITY @comcast What are y'all even doing with an office 5 minutes from my house if you can't even service it?!
CandiceBenbow;Update: @comcastcares @XFINITY Techs come out&amp say @comcast isn't even servicing my area yet so they don't understand why install was booked.
CandiceBenbow;"""You can be smart AND pretty. I don't know they told us we couldn't be both.""   ...grateful for the word of God whenever it is spoken."
CandiceBenbow;@comcastcares It wasn't a missed appointment. Tech came late, called for backup and they never finished the job. They just left w/o a word.
CandiceBenbow;@comcast @comcastcares I shouldn't have to be inconvenienced because of your negligence.
CandiceBenbow;@comcast @comcastcares Now, I have to waste another morning waiting on you to do what you said you'd do THIS morning.
CandiceBenbow;"@comcast @comcastcares You guys should do better. This whole ""it's after 3pm, we can't send anyone out"" is ridiculous."
CandiceBenbow;@comcast @comcastcares ...so I wasted my entire day waiting for install only for it not to happen and then they schedule for tomorrow
CandiceBenbow;New @comcast @comcastcares customer. Install scheduled 9-11am. Tech comes at 12:15. Left at 3:30 w/o a word. Still no service. Way to go! 😑

CandiceBenbow;@ShamineMarie Hea. Links are in my TL.
CandiceBenbow;Happy Valentine's Day, y'all. I hope love finds its way to you in some capacity.
CandiceBenbow;All I know is I see all of us. Some days, seeing all of us is all I got. Maybe that's enough. Maybe it's just good to know we're not alone.
CandiceBenbow;"And I reject those ""in time, it will"" narratives that work to diminish what we actually feel."
CandiceBenbow;I don't know if/when lasting love will find us- those of us still looking for it.
CandiceBenbow;Naming all of that, in part, is the only road to freedom.
CandiceBenbow;Be clear. The church is largely responsible for my singleness.
CandiceBenbow;And I'm even more unapologetic about holding the Church accountable for false teachings that bruise and wound.
CandiceBenbow;Now, more than I ever have, I desire lasting love and the creation of family. And I'm unapologetic. I don't let anyone tell me it's wrong.
CandiceBenbow;I know what it feels like to be changed because of the lack of good love in ways you can't share or be honest about.
CandiceBenbow;I am a woman. I know what heartbreak looks like. I know what it feels to invest and not see a return.
CandiceBenbow;I think that's where we are best able to recognize and embrace the fullness of who we are.  Finding them ain't as easy as it sounds, tho.
CandiceBenbow;I'm more invested in encouraging Black women to seek, acknowledge and flourish within healing spaces of intimacy.
CandiceBenbow;Last night, on a panel about Black love, I said I'm not interested at all in teaching abstinence and celibacy to Black women.
CandiceBenbow;That thang ain't easy, tho.
CandiceBenbow;I've spent a lot of time thinking through how love will be a part of my life and how I must always stay within a posture of wholeness.
CandiceBenbow;Though one is for Valentine's Day, I didn't know both of my pieces would come out today. It's actually rather fitting and divine.
CandiceBenbow;...what a wonderful surprise! I love Valentines!!! https://t.co/D5aUn9Xv7v
CandiceBenbow;My Response to Juanita Bynum’s “No More Sheets 2” #BlackSkinWhiteSin https://t.co/uzRCHiAHCu
CandiceBenbow;We must shift critique to the theologies/personalities who offer this as their only solution to Black women's desire for companionship.
CandiceBenbow;Singleness/loneliness is difficult to navigate on any given day- particularly one centered around love and relationships.
CandiceBenbow;"While I am definitely not a fan of ""God is My Man/Jesus is My Valentine"" ideologies, I hope we are gentle today with women who are."
CandiceBenbow;Here, I work through what it means to sit with pain and how it changes us as a crucial part of moving forward. https://t.co/cD1bUjksFH
CandiceBenbow;Yaaas! Miss you so! https://t.co/OT930tGvWL

_AllisonMathews;#restinpower to a wonderful woman, leader &amp  church member #blackcatholic https://t.co/onNKtE06SR
_AllisonMathews;What about dating while living with HIV? Identity making while living with HIV? Stigma management? Social support &amp  what that looks like?
_AllisonMathews;We also have to shift from just researching disease prevention to improving quality of life for people living with diseases
_AllisonMathews;Some docs fall into trap of treating disease rather than treating people. @2BeatHIV tries to preempt that by involving the pub in decisions
_AllisonMathews;To be honest, many PLWH aren't even concerned ab being Poz so much as they are worried ab cancer, diabetes, drug abuse, police violence
_AllisonMathews;Feedback 4m PLWH tells us that they r more than their disease. They are HUMANS with lives, fams, desires, jobs, other interests &amp  challenges
_AllisonMathews;It makes sense given our political current climate, but we also have to remember that the push to treat patients as PEOPLE FIRST is new
_AllisonMathews;Surprisingly, ppl who know me tell me that these ideals aren't always translated to all research, health care, or businesses
_AllisonMathews;Not trying to downplay it but I see my work as just a natural extension of my personality: care for others, have fun, empower together
_AllisonMathews;The past few days I've been trying to figure out y people r so excited ab my work. I love what I do but it seems normal, natural...basic
